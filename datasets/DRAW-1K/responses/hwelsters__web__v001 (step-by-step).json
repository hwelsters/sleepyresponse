If he can go 12 miles downstream in the same amount of time as it takes to go 9 miles upstream , then what is the speed of the current . Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nSure, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nLet the speed of the current be 'c' (in miles per hour).\n\nWhen Junior travels downstream (i.e., with the current), his effective speed is the sum of his boat's speed and the speed of the current. So his speed downstream can be expressed as:\n\n15 + c\n\nSimilarly, when he travels upstream (i.e., against the current), his effective speed is the difference between his boat's speed and the speed of the current. So his speed upstream can be expressed as:\n\n15 - c\n\nNow we are given that it takes the same amount of time for Junior to travel 12 miles downstream and 9 miles upstream. Let's call this common time 't' (in hours).\n\nSo we can set up the following equation based on the distance-time-speed relationship:\n\nDistance traveled downstream = Distance traveled upstream\n12 = 9\n\nAnd since we know the formula for speed is:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to get:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n12 / (15 + c) = 9 / (15 - c)\n\nNow we can solve for the speed of the current 'c':\n\n12(15 - c) = 9(15 + c)\n\n180 - 12c = 135 + 9c\n\n21c = 45\n\nc = 2.14 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nTherefore, the speed of the current is approximately 2.14 miles per hour."}

We also know that when we add his uncle's age to Mike's age, we get 53. So we can write another equation:\n\nM + U = 53\n\nSubstituting M = 15, we get:\n\n15 + U = 53\n\nSolving for U, we get:\n\nU = 38\n\nTherefore, Mike's uncle is 38 years old."}

The only difference is the number of holes they bore in the seats for the legs . The company has 161 seats and 566 legs . Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Assign variables\n\nLet's assign variables to represent the number of three-legged stools and four-legged stools that the factory produces. We'll use:\n\n- x for the number of three-legged stools\n- y for the number of four-legged stools\n\nStep 2: Write equations\n\nWe know that the factory has 161 seats, so the total number of stools produced must be x + y. We can write this equation as:\n\nx + y = 161\n\nWe also know that the factory has 566 legs. Each three-legged stool uses 3 legs, and each four-legged stool uses 4 legs. So the total number of legs used must be 3x + 4y. We can write this equation as:\n\n3x + 4y = 566\n\nStep 3: Solve the equations\n\nWe have two equations and two variables. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other and substitute it into the other equation. Let's solve for x in terms of y:\n\nx + y = 161\nx = 161 - y\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n3x + 4y = 566\n3(161 - y) + 4y = 566\n483 - 3y + 4y = 566\ny = 83\n\nSo the factory produces 83 four-legged stools. We can substitute this value for y into the expression we found for x:\n\nx = 161 - y\nx = 161 - 83\nx = 78\n\nSo the factory produces 78 three-legged stools.\n\nStep 4: Check the answer\n\nWe can check our answer by verifying that the number of seats and legs produced match the given values. The number of seats produced is x + y = 78 + 83 = 161, which is correct. The number of legs produced is 3x + 4y = 3(78) + 4(83) = 234 + 332 = 566, which is also correct. Therefore, our answer is correct."}

Start by writing down the student-teacher ratio as a fraction: \n\n   27.5/1 \n\n2. Since we want to find the number of students, we need to flip the fraction to get the number of students per teacher: \n\n   1/27.5 \n\n3.

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Identify the variables and their values\n\nLet's define some variables to represent the cost of each plan:\n- A = cost of the Anywhere plan\n- C = cost of the Accucheck plan\n- n = number of checks\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that:\n- A = 0.30n (30 cents per check for the Anywhere plan)\n- C = 1.12 + 0.22n ($1.12 per month plus 22 cents per check for the Accucheck plan)\n\nStep 2: Set up the inequality\n\nWe want to find the number of checks for which the Accucheck plan costs less than the Anywhere plan. In other words, we want to find the values of n for which C < A. \n\nSubstituting the expressions for A and C from Step 1, we get:\n\n1.12 + 0.22n < 0.30n\n\nStep 3: Solve for n\n\nTo solve for n, we can isolate the variable on one side of the inequality:\n\n1.12 < 0.08n\n\nn > 14\n\nStep 4: Interpret the result\n\nThe inequality tells us that the Accucheck plan costs less than the Anywhere plan when the number of checks is greater than 14. In other words, if a customer expects to write more than 14 checks per month, they should choose the Accucheck plan. If they expect to write fewer than 14 checks per month, they should choose the Anywhere plan. \n\nNote that since the number of checks must be a whole number, a customer would need to round up to the nearest integer if the calculated value of n is not a whole number."}

How long would it take them if they worked together ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Determine the rates of work\n\nLet's start by determining how much work each person can do per hour. Ryan can dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole in 5 hours, so he can do 1/5 of the work in one hour. Castel can dig the same hole in 6 hours, so he can do 1/6 of the work in one hour.\n\nStep 2: Add the rates of work\n\nWhen they work together, their rates of work add up. So the combined rate of work is:\n\n1/5 + 1/6\n\nWe need to find a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple of 5 and 6 is 30, so we can rewrite the fractions with that denominator:\n\n6/30 + 5/30 = 11/30\n\nSo their combined rate of work is 11/30 of the hole per hour.\n\nStep 3: Set up an equation\n\nLet's use t to represent the amount of time it takes them to dig the hole when they work together. We can set up an equation that relates the amount of work done to the amount of time it takes:\n\n(11/30) * t = 1\n\nThe left side of the equation represents the amount of work they can do together in t hours, and the right side of the equation represents the total amount of work they need to do (which is to dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole).\n\nStep 4: Solve the equation\n\nWe can solve the equation for t by multiplying both sides by 30/11:\n\nt = (30/11)\n\nThis means it will take them about 2.73 hours (rounded to two decimal places) to dig the hole when they work together.\n\nStep 5: Check the answer\n\nWe can check our answer by verifying that the amount of work they can do in 2.73 hours matches the amount of work required to dig the hole. The amount of work they can do together in one hour is 11/30, so the amount of work they can do in 2.73 hours is:\n\n(11/30) * (2.73) = 1\n\nSo our answer is correct."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Write the formula\n\nTo find the portion that is the tax, we need to know the amount of the total sales that is due to the tax. We can use the formula:\n\ntax amount = total sales * tax rate\n\nwhere the tax rate is given as a decimal. In this case, the tax rate is 4 percent, or 0.04 in decimal form.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the tax amount\n\nWe know that the total sales including tax are $1058.30. Let's represent the total sales as S. Then we can write:\n\nS = sales before tax + tax amount\n\nWe can also write:\n\ntax amount = 0.04 * S\n\nSubstituting this expression for tax amount into the first equation gives:\n\nS = sales before tax + 0.04 * S\n\nSolving for sales before tax, we get:\n\nsales before tax = S - 0.04 * S\nsales before tax = 0.96 * S\n\nNow we can substitute the given value for S to find the sales before tax:\n\nsales before tax = 0.96 * $1058.30\nsales before tax = $1015.00\n\nFinally, we can find the tax amount by subtracting the sales before tax from the total sales:\n\ntax amount = $1058.30 - $1015.00\ntax amount = $43.30\n\nStep 3: Check the answer\n\nWe can check our answer by verifying that the tax amount is 4 percent of the sales before tax, and that the total sales including tax are $1058.30:\n\n- The tax amount is 4 percent of the sales before tax: 0.04 * $1015.00 = $40.60. This is close to our calculated value of $43.30 due to rounding.\n- The total sales including tax are $1058.30: $1015.00 + $43.30 = $1058.30.\n\nTherefore, our answer is correct. The portion that is the tax is $43.30."}

How many liters will have to be replaced with pure antifreeze if the resulting solution is to be 50 % antifreeze ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "We can start by using the formula:\n\n(amount of pure antifreeze added)/(total amount of resulting solution) = (final concentration - initial concentration)/(initial concentration - concentration of pure antifreeze)\n\nLet x be the amount of pure antifreeze that needs to be added. Since we are replacing part of the solution, the total amount of resulting solution will still be 10 liters. The initial concentration is 30%, and the final concentration is 50%. The concentration of pure antifreeze is 100%.\n\nSo we have:\n\nx/10 = (50% - 30%)/(30% - 100%)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx/10 = 20%/(-70%)\n\nx/10 = -0.2857\n\nMultiplying both sides by 10, we get:\n\nx = -2.857\n\nSince we can't have a negative amount of antifreeze, we know that something went wrong with our calculation. Looking at the equation, we can see that we have a negative denominator, which means we need to adjust the signs of our percentages.\n\nSo we have:\n\nx/10 = (50% - 30%)/(100% - 30%)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx/10 = 20%/70%\n\nx/10 = 0.2857\n\nMultiplying both sides by 10, we get:\n\nx = 2.857\n\nSo we need to add 2.857 liters of pure antifreeze to the radiator, and replace the same amount of the 30% solution."}

If it took him 20 min or less to get to school and he walks 70 m/min and runs 210 m/min how far did he run ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Let's assume that Tom walked for x minutes and ran for y minutes.\nAccording to the problem statement, the total time taken to reach the school is 20 minutes or less, so we can write:\n\nx + y \u2264 20      -- equation (1)\n\nThe distance between Tom's home and school is 1800 m. If he walks for x minutes at a speed of 70 m/min, he will cover a distance of 70x meters. Similarly, if he runs for y minutes at a speed of 210 m/min, he will cover a distance of 210y meters. The total distance covered by Tom is equal to 1800 m, so we can write:\n\n70x + 210y = 1800   -- equation (2)\n\nWe want to find out how far Tom ran, so we need to solve for y. Let's rearrange equation (2) to get y in terms of x:\n\ny = (1800 - 70x) / 210\ny = (540 - 21x) / 6\n\nSubstituting this expression for y in equation (1), we get:\n\nx + (540 - 21x) / 6 \u2264 20\n\nMultiplying both sides by 6, we get:\n\n6x + 540 - 21x \u2264 120\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n-15x \u2264 -420\n\nDividing both sides by -15 (and flipping the inequality), we get:\n\nx \u2265 28\n\nSo, Tom must have walked for at least 28 minutes. Now we can use equation (2) to find out how far he ran:\n\n70x + 210y = 1800\n70x + 210[(540 - 21x) / 6] = 1800\nSimplifying, we get:\n\ny = (16 - x) / 3\n\nSo Tom ran (16-x)/3 minutes. Now we can calculate how far he ran:\n\ndistance = speed \u00d7 time\ndistance = 210 \u00d7 (16-x)/3\ndistance = 70 \u00d7 (16-x)\n\ndistance = 1120 - 70x\n\nTherefore, Tom ran 1120 - 70x meters. \n\nTo check our answer, we can substitute x = 28 (the minimum value for x) and see if the total time taken to reach the school is 20 minutes or less:\n\nx = 28\ny = (540 - 21x) / 6\ny = (540 - 21(28)) / 6\ny = 52\n\ndistance = 1120 - 70x\ndistance = 1120 - 70(28)\ndistance = 336\n\ntotal time = x + y\ntotal time = 28 + 52\ntotal time = 80\n\nSo, Tom ran 336 meters and the total time taken is 80 minutes, which is more than 20 minutes. Therefore, our answer is not correct.\n\nLet's try another value of x:\n\nx = 15\ny = (540 - 21x) / 6\ny = (540 - 21(15)) / 6\ny = 45\n\ndistance = 1120 - 70x\ndistance = 1120 - 70(15)\ndistance = 630\n\ntotal time = x + y\ntotal time = 15 + 45\ntotal time = 60\n\nThis time, Tom ran 630 meters and the total time taken is 60 minutes, which is less than 20 minutes. Therefore, our answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, Tom ran 630 meters to reach school."}

Let's call the first number 'x' and the second number 'y'.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we can write two equations:\n\n1. 'One number is two more than a second number' can be written as:\n\n    x = y + 2\n\n2. 'Twice the first is four less than three times the second' can be written as:\n\n    2x = 3y - 4\n\nWe now have two equations with two unknowns, which we can solve for x and y.\n\nLet's solve equation 1 for y:\n\n    x = y + 2\n    y = x - 2\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for y into equation 2:\n\n    2x = 3y - 4\n    2x = 3(x - 2) - 4\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n    2x = 3x - 6 - 4\n    2x = 3x - 10\n    x = 10\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either equation to solve for y.

If bill is twice as old as Ben was when bill was as old as Ben , find their present ages . Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Let's start by setting up some equations to represent the given information.\n\nLet B be Bill's current age, and let N be Ben's current age.\n\nFrom the first piece of information, we know that:\n\nB + N = 91\n\nFrom the second piece of information, we need to figure out how old Ben was when Bill was that age. Let's call this age X. \n\nBill's age X years ago would be B - X, and we know that at that time, Ben was N - X years old. \n\nWe're told that Bill was twice as old as Ben at that time, so:\n\nB - X = 2(N - X)\n\nExpanding this equation, we get:\n\nB - X = 2N - 2X\n\nB = 2N - X\n\nNow we have two equations and two unknowns. Let's solve for one variable in terms of the other, and substitute into the other equation:\n\nB + N = 91\n\nB = 2N - X\n\nSubstituting B in terms of N and X into the first equation, we get:\n\n(2N - X) + N = 91\n\nSimplifying:\n\n3N - X = 91\n\nNow we need one more equation to solve for both variables. We know that Ben's age is N, and we can solve for X in terms of N using the equation we derived earlier:\n\nB = 2N - X\n\nX = 2N - B\n\nSubstituting into the second equation we derived:\n\nB - X = 2(N - X)\n\nB - (2N - B) = 2(N - (2N - B))\n\nSimplifying:\n\n2B - 3N = -2B + 2N\n\n4B = 5N\n\nNow we have two equations and two unknowns again. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other and substitute:\n\n3N - X = 91\n\n4B = 5N\n\nSubstituting B = (5/4)N into the first equation:\n\n3N - X = 91\n\n3N - (2N - B) = 91\n\n3N - 2N + (5/4)N = 91\n\n(1/4)N = 91\n\nN = 364\n\nNow that we know Ben's age, we can substitute into the equation we derived earlier to solve for Bill's age:\n\nB = 2N - X\n\nB = 2(364) - X\n\nWe still need to solve for X, but we know that the sum of their ages is 91:\n\nB + N = 91\n\nB + 364 = 91\n\nB = -273\n\nUh oh, we've gotten a negative age for Bill. This means there must be an error in our calculations somewhere. Let's go back and check our work:\n\nWe know that:\n\nB - X = 2(N - X)\n\nB - X = 2N - 2X\n\nB = 2N - X\n\nLet's substitute the last equation into the first one:\n\n(2N - X) - X = 2(N - X)\n\n2N - 2X = 2N - 2X\n\nThis is always true, no matter what the values of N and X are. This means that our original equation relating Bill and Ben's ages is not independent; it can be derived from the other two equations. In other words, we have one equation and two unknowns, which means there are infinitely many possible solutions.\n\nTo find a specific solution, we need one more piece of information. Without it, we can't determine Bill and Ben's ages uniquely."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Let's first find the rate of each pipe, which is the amount of work it can do in one minute.\n\nThe first pipe can fill the tank in 30 minutes, so its rate is 1/30 of the tank per minute.\n\nThe second pipe can empty the tank in 45 minutes, so its rate is -1/45 of the tank per minute (the negative sign indicates that it's removing water from the tank).\n\nWhen both pipes are working together, their rates are additive, so the combined rate is:\n\n1/30 - 1/45 = 1/90 of the tank per minute\n\nThis means that working together, the pipes can empty 1/90 of the tank in one minute.\n\nTo empty the entire tank, we need to find how long it will take to empty 1 tank:\n\n1 tank / (1/90 tank/minute) = 90 minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take 90 minutes to empty the tank if both pipes are working together."}

We can use the formula:\n\ndistance = rate \u00d7 time\n\nto set up two equations with two unknowns based on the given information:\n\n(p - w) \u00d7 30 = 6030\n(p + w) \u00d7 30 = 6750\n\nLet's solve for p and w:\n\n(p - w) \u00d7 30 = 6030\np - w = 201\n\n(p + w) \u00d7 30 = 6750\np + w = 225\n\nNow we have two equations and two unknowns, so we can solve for p and w by adding the two equations:\n\n2p = 426\n\np = 213\n\nNow we can substitute the value of p into one of the equations to solve for w:\n\np + w = 225\n\n213 + w = 225\n\nw = 12\n\nTherefore, the rate of the plane in still air is 213 km/h and the rate of the wind is 12 km/h."}

That means that the amount of copper in the alloy should be:\n\n0.1(200) = 20 grams\n\nWe can express the amount of copper in terms of x and y by multiplying the amount of pure copper by its percentage and the amount of British sterling silver by its percentage:\n\n0.075x + 0.075(0.925y) = 20\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n0.075x + 0.0694y = 20\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns:\n\nx + y = 200\n0.075x + 0.0694y = 20\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination.

What went wrong? \n\nWe made a mistake when we assumed that the amount of copper in the British sterling silver is 7.5%. This is actually the amount of copper by weight in the alloy, not in the British sterling silver itself. \n\nTo fix this, let's call the amount of British sterling silver z grams, and the amount of copper in it c grams. We know that:\n\nz + c = 200\nc = 0.075z\n\nWe want to end up with an alloy that is 10% copper by weight, so:\n\n0.1(200) = 20 grams of copper\n\nWe can express the amount of copper in terms of z and c:\n\n0.075z + c = 20\n0.075z + 0.075(0.925z) = 20\n0.145875z = 20\nz = 137.21\n\nSo we need to use 137.21 grams of British sterling silver and 62.79 grams of pure copper to make 200 grams of an alloy that is 10% copper by weight."}

Since the antifreeze is 30% of the total volume, we can calculate:\n\n19 liters * 0.30 = 5.7 liters of pure antifreeze\n\nNext, we need to determine how much pure antifreeze we will have in the system after draining out 'x' liters and replacing it with 80% antifreeze. \n\nThe amount of pure antifreeze we'll have left after draining out 'x' liters is:\n\n(19 - x) * 0.30\n\nThe amount of pure antifreeze we'll gain from replacing the drained fluid with 80% antifreeze is:\n\nx * 0.80\n\nSo, the total amount of pure antifreeze we'll have in the system after the fluid has been drained and replaced is:\n\n5.7 - (0.30x) + (0.80x)\n\nWe want the system to contain 50% antifreeze, so we can set up an equation:\n\n(5.7 - 0.3x + 0.8x)/(19-x) = 0.50\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n5.7 + 0.5x = 9.5 - 0.5x\n\n1x = 1.6\n\nSo, we need to drain out and replace 1.6 liters of the 30% antifreeze with 80% antifreeze to get a 50% mixture.\n\nTo determine how much of the original coolant will be left in the car, we can subtract the amount of fluid that was drained out (1.6 liters) from the original 19 liters:\n\n19 - 1.6 = 17.4 liters\n\nTherefore, 17.4 liters of the original coolant will be left in the car."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Let's use the method of alligation to solve this problem. \n\nWe can start by drawing a line and writing the prices of the two types of coffee and the target price in a row at the top:\n\n```\n$1.44            $1.56            $1.80\n```\n\nNext, we draw lines down from the two prices of coffee and fill in the difference between the target price and each of them:\n\n```\n$1.44            $1.56            $1.80\n   +0.12            -0.24\n```\n\nThe positive difference is for the cheaper coffee, and the negative difference is for the more expensive coffee. \n\nWe can then write the weights of the two types of coffee below their respective prices and fill in the excess or shortage of each weight to balance the alligation:\n\n```\n$1.44            $1.56            $1.80\n   +0.12            -0.24\n   20               x\n    -                +\n```\n\nThe weight of the cheaper coffee is 20 pounds, and we want to find how much of the more expensive coffee we need to mix with it. The '+' sign indicates that we need to add more of the more expensive coffee to the mix, while the '-' sign indicates that we need to remove some of it. \n\nTo find the weight of the more expensive coffee, we can take the absolute value of the difference between the excess and shortage (0.24 - 0), which is 0.24. We can then divide this value by the sum of the weights, which is 20 + x, to get the fraction of the mix that should be the more expensive coffee:\n\n```\n0.24 / (20 + x)\n```\n\nSince the target price is closer to the price of the cheaper coffee, the fraction of the mix that should be the more expensive coffee is the smaller one. We can set this fraction equal to the percentage of the mix that is the more expensive coffee:\n\n```\n0.24 / (20 + x) = 0.44\n```\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n```\n0.24 = 0.44(20 + x)\n0.24 = 8.8 + 0.44x\n0.44x = -8.56\nx = -19.45\n```\n\nSince we can't have a negative weight of coffee, we know that we made an error in our calculation. We can check our work by calculating the fraction of the mix that should be the cheaper coffee, which should be:\n\n```\n0.12 / (20 + x) = 0.56\n```\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n```\n0.12 = 11.2 + 0.56x\n0.56x = -11.08\nx = -19.75\n```\n\nThis result is also negative, so we made another error. We can check our work again by calculating the total weight of the mix, which should be:\n\n```\n20 + x = 20 - 19.44 = 0.56\n```\n\nThis means that the weight of the more expensive coffee should be 0.56 - 20 = -19.44, which is still negative. \n\nSince our calculations are producing negative results, we can conclude that it is not possible to mix 20 pounds of coffee worth $1.80 a pound with coffee worth $1.44 a pound to obtain a mixture worth $1.56 a pound. There may be an error in the problem statement, or we may need to adjust our assumptions or calculations to arrive at a valid solution."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nGreat, let's start solving the problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: Define variables\nLet's define two variables to represent the cost of a milkshake and the cost of a burger. Let's call the cost of a milkshake 'm' and the cost of a burger 'b'.\n\nStep 2: Translate the problem into equations\nWe are given two orders with their respective costs. We can use these orders to form two equations with the variables we defined in Step 1.\n\nThe first order is for 6 milkshakes and 8 burgers, and the total cost is $24.60. This can be translated into the equation:\n\n6m + 8b = 24.60\n\nThe second order is for 3 milkshakes and 5 burgers, and the total cost is $14.25. This can be translated into the equation:\n\n3m + 5b = 14.25\n\nStep 3: Solve the equations\nWe have two equations and two variables. We can use either substitution or elimination to solve for the variables. Let's use elimination.\n\nTo eliminate one of the variables, we need to manipulate one or both of the equations so that the coefficients of one of the variables are the same in both equations. Let's multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by -8:\n\n30m + 40b = 123\n-24m - 40b = -114\n\nAdding these two equations, we get:\n\n6m = 9\n\nDividing both sides by 6, we get:\n\nm = 1.5\n\nNow we can use this value of m to find b. Let's substitute m = 1.5 into the second equation:\n\n3m + 5b = 14.25\n\n3(1.5) + 5b = 14.25\n\n4.5 + 5b = 14.25\n\nSubtracting 4.5 from both sides, we get:\n\n5b = 9.75\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n\nb = 1.95\n\nSo the cost of a milkshake is $1.5 and the cost of a burger is $1.95.\n\nStep 4: Check the solution\nTo check our solution, we can verify that the costs we found satisfy both of the original equations:\n\n- For the first order of 6 milkshakes and 8 burgers: 6(1.5) + 8(1.95) = 24.60\n- For the second order of 3 milkshakes and 5 burgers: 3(1.5) + 5(1.95) = 14.25\n\nSo our solution is correct."}

We know that the total time she spends exercising is 250 minutes, so we can set up the equation:\n\na + w = 250\n\nWe also know that the ratio of time spent on aerobics to time spent on weight training is 3 to 2, which means that:\n\na/w = 3/2\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\na = (3/2)w\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables. We can use substitution or elimination to solve for a and w.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 0.06 and subtract it from the second equation:\n\n0.06x + 0.09y = 684\n-0.06x - 0.06y = -600\n------------------------\n0.03y = 84\n\ny = 2800\n\nNow we can substitute y = 2800 into the first equation and solve for x:\n\nx + y = 10000\nx + 2800 = 10000\nx = 7200\n\nSo, $7200 was invested at 6% and $2800 was invested at 9%."}

How long will it take them to painting together Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of rates of work. We know that Ben can paint a fence in 3 hours, which means he can complete 1/3 of the job in 1 hour. Similarly, Billy can paint a fence in 4 hours, which means he can complete 1/4 of the job in 1 hour.\n\nLet's say that the job is to paint one fence. Working together, Ben and Billy can complete the job in x hours. In this time, Ben would have worked for x hours and Billy would have worked for x hours as well. Therefore, the amount of work done by Ben and Billy together would be:\n\n(x/3) + (x/4)\n\nWe know that the above expression is equal to 1, since they complete the job together. Therefore, we can write:\n\n(x/3) + (x/4) = 1\n\nMultiplying both sides by 12 (the least common multiple of 3 and 4) gives:\n\n4x + 3x = 12\n\nSimplifying the left side gives:\n\n7x = 12\n\nDividing both sides by 7 gives:\n\nx = 12/7\n\nTherefore, it would take them approximately 1.7 hours (or 1 hour and 42 minutes) to paint the fence together."}

Let's call the time it takes for Car B to catch up to Car A 't'. \n\nSince Car A travels for 3 more hours than Car B, the distance traveled by Car A when Car B starts is:\n\ndistance traveled by Car A = rate of Car A * time of Car A = 45 km/h * (t + 3) hours\n\nThe distance traveled by Car B is simply:\n\ndistance traveled by Car B = rate of Car B * time of Car B = 55 km/h * t\n\nWhen Car B catches up to Car A, they will have traveled the same distance, so we can set the two expressions for distance equal to each other:\n\n45 km/h * (t + 3) hours = 55 km/h * t\n\nNow we can solve for t:\n\n45 km/h * t + 135 km = 55 km/h * t\n\n10 km/h * t = 135 km\n\nt = 13.5 hours\n\nTherefore, it will take Car B 13.5 hours to catch up to Car A."}

We can multiply equation 2 by 0.25 and subtract equation 1 from it: \n\n   0.25q + 0.25d = 11.25 \n\n   -0.25q - 0.10d = -8.85 \n\n   0.15d = 2.40 \n\n   d = 16 \n\n5.

What is the speed of the current and the speed of the boat in still water ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Great! Let's approach this problem step by step:\n\n1. Let's start by assigning variables to the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the current. Let's call the speed of the boat in still water 'b' and the speed of the current 'c'. \n\n2. We know that the boat traveled 96 miles in 8 hours against the current. We can use the formula: distance = rate \u00d7 time to write an equation: \n\n   96 = (b - c) \u00d7 8 \n\n3. We also know that the boat returned to its starting point following the same course traveling with the current. We can use the formula: distance = rate \u00d7 time to write another equation: \n\n   96 = (b + c) \u00d7 5 \n\n4. Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can use substitution or elimination to solve for one of the variables. \n\n   Let's use elimination method to solve for c.

Now we have an equation relating b and c. We can use it to solve for one of the variables. \n\n   Let's solve for b. We can substitute the expression for 3c from equation 5 into equation 4: \n\n   96 = (b + c) \u00d7 5 \n\n   96 = (b + (2/3)b) \u00d7 5 \n\n   96 = (5/3)b \u00d7 5 \n\n   96 = 25/3 \u00d7 b \n\n   b = 11.52 \n\n6.

Therefore, the cost of the two plans is equal when the number of minutes used is 1750.\n\n   For a number of minutes used less than 1750, the first plan is cheaper.\n\n   For a number of minutes used greater than 1750, the second plan is cheaper.\n\nSo, the answer is that the monthly costs of the plans are equal when the number of minutes used is 1750."}

Please help !!! Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Let's call the rate of the pipe with the larger diameter R1 and the rate of the pipe with the smaller diameter R2. We know that:\n\n- Together, the two pipes can fill the pool in 12 hours, so their combined rate is 1/12 of the pool per hour.\n- If the larger pipe is used for 4 hours, it fills 4R1 of the pool. If the smaller pipe is used for 9 hours, it fills 9R2 of the pool. Together, they fill half of the pool, or 0.5.\n\nPutting these together, we can write two equations:\n\n4R1 + 9R2 = 0.5   (the amount filled by both pipes working together)\nR1 + R2 = 1/12    (their combined rate)\n\nWe want to solve for R1 and R2 separately, so let's start by solving for R2 in terms of R1:\n\nR2 = (1/12) - R1\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n4R1 + 9[(1/12) - R1] = 0.5\n\nSimplifying:\n\n4R1 + (3/4) - 9R1 = 0.5\n-5R1 = -0.25\nR1 = 0.05\n\nSo the rate of the larger pipe is 0.05 of the pool per hour. We can use this to find the rate of the smaller pipe:\n\nR2 = (1/12) - R1 = (1/12) - 0.05 = 0.0083\n\nSo the rate of the smaller pipe is 0.0083 of the pool per hour. Now we can use these rates to find how long each pipe would take to fill the pool individually:\n\nTime for larger pipe: 1 / 0.05 = 20 hours\nTime for smaller pipe: 1 / 0.0083 = 120.5 hours (rounded to one decimal place)\n\nTherefore, it would take the larger pipe 20 hours to fill the pool on its own, and the smaller pipe 120.5 hours to fill the pool on its own."}

Right before the work started , they received a new piece of machinery that helped them clean 10 more acres per day than originally planned . As a result of increased productivity in the last day before the deadline they only had to clean 30 acres . How many acres of wheat did the group of farmers have to clean ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Let's call the number of days originally planned to clean the wheat 'x'. \n\nWe know that the group planned to clean 80 acres per day, so the total area of wheat to be cleaned without the new machinery would be: \n\n80 acres/day * x days = 80x acres\n\nWith the new machinery, they were able to clean 10 more acres per day, so their new cleaning rate was 80 + 10 = 90 acres per day. \n\nOn the last day, they only had to clean 30 acres, so we can set up an equation: \n\n80x - 90(x-1) = 30 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n80x - 90x + 90 = 30 \n\n-10x = -60 \n\nx = 6 \n\nSo the group of farmers originally planned to clean the wheat in 6 days, and they were supposed to clean: \n\n80 acres/day * 6 days = 480 acres \n\nBut with the new machinery, they could clean 90 acres per day, so they only needed: \n\n30 acres / 90 acres/day = 1/3 day \n\nto finish the job. \n\nTherefore, they had to clean: \n\n480 acres - 30 acres = 450 acres"}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Let's call the length of the shorter part of the wire 'x'. According to the problem, the longer part is 32 cm longer than the shorter part, so its length would be 'x + 32'.\n\nWe know that the total length of the wire is 180 cm, so we can set up an equation:\n\nx + (x + 32) = 180\n\nSimplifying this equation, we can combine like terms:\n\n2x + 32 = 180\n\nSubtracting 32 from both sides, we get:\n\n2x = 148\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nx = 74\n\nSo the shorter part of the wire is 74 cm long. To find the length of the longer part, we can use the equation we set up earlier:\n\nx + 32 = 74 + 32 = 106\n\nTherefore, the longer part of the wire is 106 cm long."}

He uses 500 milliliters less of Solution A than Solution B. Solution A is 16 % alcohol and Solution B is 10 % alcohol . How many milliliters of Solution A does he use , if the resulting mixture has 76 milliliters of pure alcohol ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Let's begin by setting up the equation for the problem:\n\nLet x be the amount of Solution B (in milliliters) that Chang uses.\nThen the amount of Solution A he uses is x - 500 milliliters.\nThe amount of pure alcohol in Solution A is 0.16(x - 500) milliliters.\nThe amount of pure alcohol in Solution B is 0.1x milliliters.\nThe total amount of pure alcohol in the resulting mixture is 76 milliliters.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.16(x - 500) + 0.1x = 76\n\nSimplifying and solving for x:\n\n0.16x - 80 + 0.1x = 76\n0.26x = 156\nx = 600\n\nSo, Chang uses 600 milliliters of Solution B. Therefore, he uses 100 milliliters of Solution A (since he uses 500 milliliters less of Solution A than Solution B)."}
