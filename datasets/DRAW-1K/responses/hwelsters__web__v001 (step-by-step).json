If he can go 12 miles downstream in the same amount of time as it takes to go 9 miles upstream , then what is the speed of the current . Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nSure, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nLet the speed of the current be 'c' (in miles per hour).\n\nWhen Junior travels downstream (i.e., with the current), his effective speed is the sum of his boat's speed and the speed of the current. So his speed downstream can be expressed as:\n\n15 + c\n\nSimilarly, when he travels upstream (i.e., against the current), his effective speed is the difference between his boat's speed and the speed of the current. So his speed upstream can be expressed as:\n\n15 - c\n\nNow we are given that it takes the same amount of time for Junior to travel 12 miles downstream and 9 miles upstream. Let's call this common time 't' (in hours).\n\nSo we can set up the following equation based on the distance-time-speed relationship:\n\nDistance traveled downstream = Distance traveled upstream\n12 = 9\n\nAnd since we know the formula for speed is:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to get:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n12 / (15 + c) = 9 / (15 - c)\n\nNow we can solve for the speed of the current 'c':\n\n12(15 - c) = 9(15 + c)\n\n180 - 12c = 135 + 9c\n\n21c = 45\n\nc = 2.14 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nTherefore, the speed of the current is approximately 2.14 miles per hour."}

We also know that when we add his uncle's age to Mike's age, we get 53. So we can write another equation:\n\nM + U = 53\n\nSubstituting M = 15, we get:\n\n15 + U = 53\n\nSolving for U, we get:\n\nU = 38\n\nTherefore, Mike's uncle is 38 years old."}

The only difference is the number of holes they bore in the seats for the legs . The company has 161 seats and 566 legs . Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Assign variables\n\nLet's assign variables to represent the number of three-legged stools and four-legged stools that the factory produces. We'll use:\n\n- x for the number of three-legged stools\n- y for the number of four-legged stools\n\nStep 2: Write equations\n\nWe know that the factory has 161 seats, so the total number of stools produced must be x + y. We can write this equation as:\n\nx + y = 161\n\nWe also know that the factory has 566 legs. Each three-legged stool uses 3 legs, and each four-legged stool uses 4 legs. So the total number of legs used must be 3x + 4y. We can write this equation as:\n\n3x + 4y = 566\n\nStep 3: Solve the equations\n\nWe have two equations and two variables. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other and substitute it into the other equation. Let's solve for x in terms of y:\n\nx + y = 161\nx = 161 - y\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n3x + 4y = 566\n3(161 - y) + 4y = 566\n483 - 3y + 4y = 566\ny = 83\n\nSo the factory produces 83 four-legged stools. We can substitute this value for y into the expression we found for x:\n\nx = 161 - y\nx = 161 - 83\nx = 78\n\nSo the factory produces 78 three-legged stools.\n\nStep 4: Check the answer\n\nWe can check our answer by verifying that the number of seats and legs produced match the given values. The number of seats produced is x + y = 78 + 83 = 161, which is correct. The number of legs produced is 3x + 4y = 3(78) + 4(83) = 234 + 332 = 566, which is also correct. Therefore, our answer is correct."}

Start by writing down the student-teacher ratio as a fraction: \n\n   27.5/1 \n\n2. Since we want to find the number of students, we need to flip the fraction to get the number of students per teacher: \n\n   1/27.5 \n\n3.

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Identify the variables and their values\n\nLet's define some variables to represent the cost of each plan:\n- A = cost of the Anywhere plan\n- C = cost of the Accucheck plan\n- n = number of checks\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that:\n- A = 0.30n (30 cents per check for the Anywhere plan)\n- C = 1.12 + 0.22n ($1.12 per month plus 22 cents per check for the Accucheck plan)\n\nStep 2: Set up the inequality\n\nWe want to find the number of checks for which the Accucheck plan costs less than the Anywhere plan. In other words, we want to find the values of n for which C < A. \n\nSubstituting the expressions for A and C from Step 1, we get:\n\n1.12 + 0.22n < 0.30n\n\nStep 3: Solve for n\n\nTo solve for n, we can isolate the variable on one side of the inequality:\n\n1.12 < 0.08n\n\nn > 14\n\nStep 4: Interpret the result\n\nThe inequality tells us that the Accucheck plan costs less than the Anywhere plan when the number of checks is greater than 14. In other words, if a customer expects to write more than 14 checks per month, they should choose the Accucheck plan. If they expect to write fewer than 14 checks per month, they should choose the Anywhere plan. \n\nNote that since the number of checks must be a whole number, a customer would need to round up to the nearest integer if the calculated value of n is not a whole number."}

How long would it take them if they worked together ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Determine the rates of work\n\nLet's start by determining how much work each person can do per hour. Ryan can dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole in 5 hours, so he can do 1/5 of the work in one hour. Castel can dig the same hole in 6 hours, so he can do 1/6 of the work in one hour.\n\nStep 2: Add the rates of work\n\nWhen they work together, their rates of work add up. So the combined rate of work is:\n\n1/5 + 1/6\n\nWe need to find a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple of 5 and 6 is 30, so we can rewrite the fractions with that denominator:\n\n6/30 + 5/30 = 11/30\n\nSo their combined rate of work is 11/30 of the hole per hour.\n\nStep 3: Set up an equation\n\nLet's use t to represent the amount of time it takes them to dig the hole when they work together. We can set up an equation that relates the amount of work done to the amount of time it takes:\n\n(11/30) * t = 1\n\nThe left side of the equation represents the amount of work they can do together in t hours, and the right side of the equation represents the total amount of work they need to do (which is to dig a 10 ft by 10 ft hole).\n\nStep 4: Solve the equation\n\nWe can solve the equation for t by multiplying both sides by 30/11:\n\nt = (30/11)\n\nThis means it will take them about 2.73 hours (rounded to two decimal places) to dig the hole when they work together.\n\nStep 5: Check the answer\n\nWe can check our answer by verifying that the amount of work they can do in 2.73 hours matches the amount of work required to dig the hole. The amount of work they can do together in one hour is 11/30, so the amount of work they can do in 2.73 hours is:\n\n(11/30) * (2.73) = 1\n\nSo our answer is correct."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Write the formula\n\nTo find the portion that is the tax, we need to know the amount of the total sales that is due to the tax. We can use the formula:\n\ntax amount = total sales * tax rate\n\nwhere the tax rate is given as a decimal. In this case, the tax rate is 4 percent, or 0.04 in decimal form.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the tax amount\n\nWe know that the total sales including tax are $1058.30. Let's represent the total sales as S. Then we can write:\n\nS = sales before tax + tax amount\n\nWe can also write:\n\ntax amount = 0.04 * S\n\nSubstituting this expression for tax amount into the first equation gives:\n\nS = sales before tax + 0.04 * S\n\nSolving for sales before tax, we get:\n\nsales before tax = S - 0.04 * S\nsales before tax = 0.96 * S\n\nNow we can substitute the given value for S to find the sales before tax:\n\nsales before tax = 0.96 * $1058.30\nsales before tax = $1015.00\n\nFinally, we can find the tax amount by subtracting the sales before tax from the total sales:\n\ntax amount = $1058.30 - $1015.00\ntax amount = $43.30\n\nStep 3: Check the answer\n\nWe can check our answer by verifying that the tax amount is 4 percent of the sales before tax, and that the total sales including tax are $1058.30:\n\n- The tax amount is 4 percent of the sales before tax: 0.04 * $1015.00 = $40.60. This is close to our calculated value of $43.30 due to rounding.\n- The total sales including tax are $1058.30: $1015.00 + $43.30 = $1058.30.\n\nTherefore, our answer is correct. The portion that is the tax is $43.30."}

How many liters will have to be replaced with pure antifreeze if the resulting solution is to be 50 % antifreeze ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "We can start by using the formula:\n\n(amount of pure antifreeze added)/(total amount of resulting solution) = (final concentration - initial concentration)/(initial concentration - concentration of pure antifreeze)\n\nLet x be the amount of pure antifreeze that needs to be added. Since we are replacing part of the solution, the total amount of resulting solution will still be 10 liters. The initial concentration is 30%, and the final concentration is 50%. The concentration of pure antifreeze is 100%.\n\nSo we have:\n\nx/10 = (50% - 30%)/(30% - 100%)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx/10 = 20%/(-70%)\n\nx/10 = -0.2857\n\nMultiplying both sides by 10, we get:\n\nx = -2.857\n\nSince we can't have a negative amount of antifreeze, we know that something went wrong with our calculation. Looking at the equation, we can see that we have a negative denominator, which means we need to adjust the signs of our percentages.\n\nSo we have:\n\nx/10 = (50% - 30%)/(100% - 30%)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx/10 = 20%/70%\n\nx/10 = 0.2857\n\nMultiplying both sides by 10, we get:\n\nx = 2.857\n\nSo we need to add 2.857 liters of pure antifreeze to the radiator, and replace the same amount of the 30% solution."}

If it took him 20 min or less to get to school and he walks 70 m/min and runs 210 m/min how far did he run ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Let's assume that Tom walked for x minutes and ran for y minutes.\nAccording to the problem statement, the total time taken to reach the school is 20 minutes or less, so we can write:\n\nx + y \u2264 20      -- equation (1)\n\nThe distance between Tom's home and school is 1800 m. If he walks for x minutes at a speed of 70 m/min, he will cover a distance of 70x meters. Similarly, if he runs for y minutes at a speed of 210 m/min, he will cover a distance of 210y meters. The total distance covered by Tom is equal to 1800 m, so we can write:\n\n70x + 210y = 1800   -- equation (2)\n\nWe want to find out how far Tom ran, so we need to solve for y. Let's rearrange equation (2) to get y in terms of x:\n\ny = (1800 - 70x) / 210\ny = (540 - 21x) / 6\n\nSubstituting this expression for y in equation (1), we get:\n\nx + (540 - 21x) / 6 \u2264 20\n\nMultiplying both sides by 6, we get:\n\n6x + 540 - 21x \u2264 120\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n-15x \u2264 -420\n\nDividing both sides by -15 (and flipping the inequality), we get:\n\nx \u2265 28\n\nSo, Tom must have walked for at least 28 minutes. Now we can use equation (2) to find out how far he ran:\n\n70x + 210y = 1800\n70x + 210[(540 - 21x) / 6] = 1800\nSimplifying, we get:\n\ny = (16 - x) / 3\n\nSo Tom ran (16-x)/3 minutes. Now we can calculate how far he ran:\n\ndistance = speed \u00d7 time\ndistance = 210 \u00d7 (16-x)/3\ndistance = 70 \u00d7 (16-x)\n\ndistance = 1120 - 70x\n\nTherefore, Tom ran 1120 - 70x meters. \n\nTo check our answer, we can substitute x = 28 (the minimum value for x) and see if the total time taken to reach the school is 20 minutes or less:\n\nx = 28\ny = (540 - 21x) / 6\ny = (540 - 21(28)) / 6\ny = 52\n\ndistance = 1120 - 70x\ndistance = 1120 - 70(28)\ndistance = 336\n\ntotal time = x + y\ntotal time = 28 + 52\ntotal time = 80\n\nSo, Tom ran 336 meters and the total time taken is 80 minutes, which is more than 20 minutes. Therefore, our answer is not correct.\n\nLet's try another value of x:\n\nx = 15\ny = (540 - 21x) / 6\ny = (540 - 21(15)) / 6\ny = 45\n\ndistance = 1120 - 70x\ndistance = 1120 - 70(15)\ndistance = 630\n\ntotal time = x + y\ntotal time = 15 + 45\ntotal time = 60\n\nThis time, Tom ran 630 meters and the total time taken is 60 minutes, which is less than 20 minutes. Therefore, our answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, Tom ran 630 meters to reach school."}

Let's call the first number 'x' and the second number 'y'.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we can write two equations:\n\n1. 'One number is two more than a second number' can be written as:\n\n    x = y + 2\n\n2. 'Twice the first is four less than three times the second' can be written as:\n\n    2x = 3y - 4\n\nWe now have two equations with two unknowns, which we can solve for x and y.\n\nLet's solve equation 1 for y:\n\n    x = y + 2\n    y = x - 2\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for y into equation 2:\n\n    2x = 3y - 4\n    2x = 3(x - 2) - 4\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n    2x = 3x - 6 - 4\n    2x = 3x - 10\n    x = 10\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either equation to solve for y.

If bill is twice as old as Ben was when bill was as old as Ben , find their present ages . Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Let's start by setting up some equations to represent the given information.\n\nLet B be Bill's current age, and let N be Ben's current age.\n\nFrom the first piece of information, we know that:\n\nB + N = 91\n\nFrom the second piece of information, we need to figure out how old Ben was when Bill was that age. Let's call this age X. \n\nBill's age X years ago would be B - X, and we know that at that time, Ben was N - X years old. \n\nWe're told that Bill was twice as old as Ben at that time, so:\n\nB - X = 2(N - X)\n\nExpanding this equation, we get:\n\nB - X = 2N - 2X\n\nB = 2N - X\n\nNow we have two equations and two unknowns. Let's solve for one variable in terms of the other, and substitute into the other equation:\n\nB + N = 91\n\nB = 2N - X\n\nSubstituting B in terms of N and X into the first equation, we get:\n\n(2N - X) + N = 91\n\nSimplifying:\n\n3N - X = 91\n\nNow we need one more equation to solve for both variables. We know that Ben's age is N, and we can solve for X in terms of N using the equation we derived earlier:\n\nB = 2N - X\n\nX = 2N - B\n\nSubstituting into the second equation we derived:\n\nB - X = 2(N - X)\n\nB - (2N - B) = 2(N - (2N - B))\n\nSimplifying:\n\n2B - 3N = -2B + 2N\n\n4B = 5N\n\nNow we have two equations and two unknowns again. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other and substitute:\n\n3N - X = 91\n\n4B = 5N\n\nSubstituting B = (5/4)N into the first equation:\n\n3N - X = 91\n\n3N - (2N - B) = 91\n\n3N - 2N + (5/4)N = 91\n\n(1/4)N = 91\n\nN = 364\n\nNow that we know Ben's age, we can substitute into the equation we derived earlier to solve for Bill's age:\n\nB = 2N - X\n\nB = 2(364) - X\n\nWe still need to solve for X, but we know that the sum of their ages is 91:\n\nB + N = 91\n\nB + 364 = 91\n\nB = -273\n\nUh oh, we've gotten a negative age for Bill. This means there must be an error in our calculations somewhere. Let's go back and check our work:\n\nWe know that:\n\nB - X = 2(N - X)\n\nB - X = 2N - 2X\n\nB = 2N - X\n\nLet's substitute the last equation into the first one:\n\n(2N - X) - X = 2(N - X)\n\n2N - 2X = 2N - 2X\n\nThis is always true, no matter what the values of N and X are. This means that our original equation relating Bill and Ben's ages is not independent; it can be derived from the other two equations. In other words, we have one equation and two unknowns, which means there are infinitely many possible solutions.\n\nTo find a specific solution, we need one more piece of information. Without it, we can't determine Bill and Ben's ages uniquely."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Let's first find the rate of each pipe, which is the amount of work it can do in one minute.\n\nThe first pipe can fill the tank in 30 minutes, so its rate is 1/30 of the tank per minute.\n\nThe second pipe can empty the tank in 45 minutes, so its rate is -1/45 of the tank per minute (the negative sign indicates that it's removing water from the tank).\n\nWhen both pipes are working together, their rates are additive, so the combined rate is:\n\n1/30 - 1/45 = 1/90 of the tank per minute\n\nThis means that working together, the pipes can empty 1/90 of the tank in one minute.\n\nTo empty the entire tank, we need to find how long it will take to empty 1 tank:\n\n1 tank / (1/90 tank/minute) = 90 minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take 90 minutes to empty the tank if both pipes are working together."}

We can set this fraction equal to the percentage of the mix that is the more expensive coffee:\n\n```\n0.24 / (20 + x) = 0.44\n```\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n```\n0.24 = 0.44(20 + x)\n0.24 = 8.8 + 0.44x\n0.44x = -8.56\nx = -19.45\n```\n\nSince we can't have a negative weight of coffee, we know that we made an error in our calculation. We can check our work by calculating the fraction of the mix that should be the cheaper coffee, which should be:\n\n```\n0.12 / (20 + x) = 0.56\n```\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n```\n0.12 = 11.2 + 0.56x\n0.56x = -11.08\nx = -19.75\n```\n\nThis result is also negative, so we made another error. We can check our work again by calculating the total weight of the mix, which should be:\n\n```\n20 + x = 20 - 19.44 = 0.56\n```\n\nThis means that the weight of the more expensive coffee should be 0.56 - 20 = -19.44, which is still negative. \n\nSince our calculations are producing negative results, we can conclude that it is not possible to mix 20 pounds of coffee worth $1.80 a pound with coffee worth $1.44 a pound to obtain a mixture worth $1.56 a pound. There may be an error in the problem statement, or we may need to adjust our assumptions or calculations to arrive at a valid solution."}

We'll start by using the first equation to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other:\n\n$x + y = 225 \\implies y = 225 - x$\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for $y$ into the second equation:\n\n$6x + 9y = 1875 \\implies 6x + 9(225 - x) = 1875$\n\nSimplifying and solving for $x$, we get:\n\n$6x + 2025 - 9x = 1875 \\implies -3x = -150 \\implies x = 50$\n\nSo 50 children attended the dinner theatre.

We know that the total number of tickets sold is 750, so:\n\na + c = 750\n\nWe also know that the total receipts for the performance were $3808.50. The amount of money from adult tickets sold is $7.50 times the number of adult tickets, or 7.5a. Similarly, the amount of money from child tickets sold is $4.00 times the number of child tickets, or 4c. So:\n\n7.5a + 4c = 3808.50\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for either 'a' or 'c' in terms of the other variable, and then substitute that expression into one of the equations to solve for the other variable.\n\nLet's solve for 'a' in terms of 'c' from the first equation:\n\na + c = 750\n\na = 750 - c\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for 'a' into the second equation:\n\n7.5a + 4c = 3808.50\n\n7.5(750 - c) + 4c = 3808.50\n\n5625 - 7.5c + 4c = 3808.50\n\n-3.5c = -1816.50\n\nc = 518\n\nSo 518 child tickets were sold.

Therefore, we can conclude that only Tap A should be used to fill the tank. \n\nUsing Tap A alone, it takes:\n18 litres / (6x) litres/min = 18/6 = 3 minutes \n\nTherefore, it takes Tap A alone 3 minutes to fill the tank."}

Let's call the first number 'x' and the second number 'y'.\n\nStep 2: Translate the problem into equations\nWe are given two equations in the problem:\n\n- Three times one number increased by twice a second number is 29: 3x + 2y = 29\n- Four times the first less three times the second is 16: 4x - 3y = 16\n\nStep 3: Solve the equations\nWe have two equations and two variables. We can solve for one of the variables in terms of the other and substitute into the other equation. For example, we can solve the first equation for y:\n\ny = (29 - 3x)/2\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n4x - 3((29 - 3x)/2) = 16\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n8x - 87 = 24\n\nAdding 87 to both sides, we get:\n\n8x = 111\n\nDividing both sides by 8, we get:\n\nx = 13.875\n\nNow we can use the first equation to find y:\n\n3x + 2y = 29\n\n3(13.875) + 2y = 29\n\n41.625 + 2y = 29\n\nSubtracting 41.625 from both sides, we get:\n\n2y = -12.625\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\ny = -6.3125\n\nSo the two numbers are approximately 13.875 and -6.3125.\n\nStep 4: Check the solution\nTo check our solution, we can substitute the values of x and y into both equations and verify that they are true. However, we see that the second number is negative, which doesn't make sense in this context of 'numbers'. Therefore, we need to conclude that there is no solution to the problem."}

Mary traveled 15 miles faster than Nick . After three hours , they were 315 miles apart . Find the rate at which each traveled . Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Let's start by assigning variables to represent the speeds of Mary and Nick. Let:\n\n- x = Nick's speed (in miles per hour)\n- x + 15 = Mary's speed (since Mary traveled 15 miles per hour faster)\n\nSince they are driving in opposite directions, the distance between them increases at a rate equal to the sum of their speeds. After three hours, the distance between them is 315 miles, so we can write:\n\n- 3x + 3(x + 15) = 315\n\nSimplifying and solving for x:\n\n- 6x + 45 = 315\n- 6x = 270\n- x = 45\n\nSo Nick's speed was 45 miles per hour, and Mary's speed was 45 + 15 = 60 miles per hour.\n\nTherefore, Mary traveled at a speed of 60 miles per hour and Nick traveled at a speed of 45 miles per hour."}

The least common multiple of 3 and 7 is 21, so we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n1/t = 7/21 + 3/21\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n1/t = 10/21\n\nMultiplying both sides by 21, we get:\n\nt = 21/10\n\nSo it takes them 2.1 hours, or 2 hours and 6 minutes, to complete the job working together.\n\nStep 4: Check the solution\nTo check our solution, we can verify that the combined work rate of the experienced bricklayer and the apprentice is enough to complete the job in 2.1 hours:\n\n- The experienced bricklayer can complete the job in 3 hours, which means he can lay 1/3 of the wall in 1 hour.\n- The apprentice can complete the job in 7 hours, which means he can lay 1/7 of the wall in 1 hour.\n- Together, their combined work rate is 1/3 + 1/7 = 10/21 of the wall in 1 hour.\n- In 2.1 hours, their combined work rate would be 2.1 x 10/21 = 1, which means they can complete the job in that time.\n\nSo our solution is correct."}

How long will it take them to mow the lawn if they work together ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula:\n\ntime = work / rate\n\nwhere 'work' is the amount of work to be done (in this case, mowing the entire lawn), and 'rate' is the rate of work (in this case, the rate at which each gardener can mow the lawn).\n\nLet's start by finding the rates of each gardener. Gardener A can mow the lawn in 3 hours, so his rate is:\n\nrate_A = work / time_A = 1 / 3 lawns per hour\n\nSimilarly, Gardener B can mow the lawn in 5 hours, so his rate is:\n\nrate_B = work / time_B = 1 / 5 lawns per hour\n\nNow we can add their rates to find their combined rate:\n\nrate_combined = rate_A + rate_B\n              = 1/3 + 1/5\n              = 8/15 lawns per hour\n\nSo together, they can mow 8/15 of a lawn in one hour. To mow the entire lawn, they need to do 1 work, so we can plug these values into the formula to find the time it takes:\n\ntime = work / rate_combined\n     = 1 / (8/15)\n     = 1.875 hours\n\nTherefore, it will take Gardener A and Gardener B 1.875 hours, or 1 hour and 52.5 minutes, to mow the lawn together."}

We know that the mixture sells for $11 per kilogram, so the total cost of the mixture will be:\n\n$11(480) = $5280\n\nSince coffee A costs $10 per kilogram, and we're using x kilograms of it, the cost of the coffee A is:\n\n$10x\n\nSimilarly, the cost of the coffee B is:\n\n$12y\n\nSince we want to mix the two coffees to get a $5280 mixture, we can set up an equation:\n\n$10x + $12y = $5280\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for one variable in one equation and substitute into the other equation:\n\nx + y = 480 \n\ny = 480 - x \n\n$10x + $12y = $5280 \n\n$10x + $12(480 - x) = $5280 \n\nSimplifying the second equation:\n\n$10x + $5760 - $12x = $5280 \n\n-$2x = -$480 \n\nx = 240 \n\nSo we need to use 240 kilograms of coffee A. To find out how much coffee B to use, we can substitute into one of the equations:\n\nx + y = 480 \n\n240 + y = 480 \n\ny = 240 \n\nSo we need to use 240 kilograms of coffee B as well.\n\nTherefore, we need to use 240 kilograms of coffee A and 240 kilograms of coffee B to make a 480 kilogram mixture."}

We can use a step-by-step approach to solve this problem. \n\nLet's start by assigning variables to the distance Fritz travels and his driving speed. \n\nLet d be the distance Fritz travels to work. \nLet s be Fritz's driving speed. \n\nWe know that Fritz's trip takes 48 minutes (0.8 hours) when he drives to work, so we can set up the following equation: \n\nEquation 1: d/s = 0.8 \n\nWe also know that Fritz's trip takes 40 minutes (0.67 hours) when he takes the train, and the train travels 6 mph faster than his driving speed, so we can set up the following equation: \n\nEquation 2: d/(s + 6) = 0.67 \n\nNow we can use algebra to solve for d. \n\nRewrite equation 1 as: \n\nd = 0.8s \n\nSubstitute this expression for d into equation 2: \n\n0.8s/(s + 6) = 0.67 \n\nSimplify: \n\n0.8s = 0.67(s + 6) \n\nDistribute: \n\n0.8s = 0.67s + 4.02 \n\nSubtract 0.67s from both sides: \n\n0.13s = 4.02 \n\nDivide both sides by 0.13: \n\ns = 30.92 \n\nNow that we know Fritz's driving speed is approximately 30.92 mph, we can substitute this value into equation 1 to find d: \n\nd = 0.8s \n\nd = 0.8(30.92) \n\nd = 24.74 \n\nTherefore, Fritz travels approximately 24.74 miles to work."}

Let's call the speed of the boat in still water 'b' and the speed of the current 'c'. \n\n2. We know that the boat traveled 96 miles in 8 hours against the current. We can use the formula: distance = rate \u00d7 time to write an equation: \n\n   96 = (b - c) \u00d7 8 \n\n3. We also know that the boat returned to its starting point following the same course traveling with the current. We can use the formula: distance = rate \u00d7 time to write another equation: \n\n   96 = (b + c) \u00d7 5 \n\n4. Now we have two equations and two unknowns.

Let x be the first odd integer, then the second odd integer is x+2 since they are consecutive.\n\nThe problem states that the sum of these two integers is at least 36, so we can write an inequality:\n\nx + (x+2) >= 36\n\nSimplifying the left side of the inequality, we get:\n\n2x + 2 >= 36\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides of the inequality, we get:\n\n2x >= 34\n\nDividing both sides of the inequality by 2, we get:\n\nx >= 17\n\nSince x is an odd integer, the smallest odd integer that is greater than or equal to 17 is 19. Therefore, the two consecutive odd integers are 19 and 21.\n\nTo check our answer, we can add these two integers:\n\n19 + 21 = 40\n\nAnd we see that the sum is indeed greater than or equal to 36. So our answer is:\n\nThe two consecutive odd integers are 19 and 21."}

We can set up two equations: \n\n   d/32 = t \n\n   d/10 = 6.3 - t \n\n4. We can solve for 't' by setting the two equations equal to each other: \n\n   d/32 = d/10 \n\n   10d = 32d \n\n   d = 10/32 = 0.3125 \n\n5.

Let F be the father's age now, and let D be the daughter's age now.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that the father is twice as old as his daughter, so we can write:\n\nF = 2D\n\nWe also know that 10 years ago, the father was 3 times as old as his daughter. So 10 years ago, the father's age was F - 10, and the daughter's age was D - 10. We can write:\n\nF - 10 = 3(D - 10)\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\nF - 10 = 3D - 30\n\nAdding 10 to both sides, we get:\n\nF = 3D - 20\n\nNow we have two equations for F in terms of D, so we can substitute one into the other to get an equation with only D:\n\n2D = 3D - 20\n\nSubtracting 2D from both sides, we get:\n\nD = 20\n\nSo the daughter is 20 years old now.

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Let's call the rate of the pipe with the larger diameter R1 and the rate of the pipe with the smaller diameter R2. We know that:\n\n- Together, the two pipes can fill the pool in 12 hours, so their combined rate is 1/12 of the pool per hour.\n- If the larger pipe is used for 4 hours, it fills 4R1 of the pool. If the smaller pipe is used for 9 hours, it fills 9R2 of the pool. Together, they fill half of the pool, or 0.5.\n\nPutting these together, we can write two equations:\n\n4R1 + 9R2 = 0.5   (the amount filled by both pipes working together)\nR1 + R2 = 1/12    (their combined rate)\n\nWe want to solve for R1 and R2 separately, so let's start by solving for R2 in terms of R1:\n\nR2 = (1/12) - R1\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n4R1 + 9[(1/12) - R1] = 0.5\n\nSimplifying:\n\n4R1 + (3/4) - 9R1 = 0.5\n-5R1 = -0.25\nR1 = 0.05\n\nSo the rate of the larger pipe is 0.05 of the pool per hour.

{"date_time": "11/03/2023 10:58:03", "question_number": 994, "question": "it takes 8 tractors 12 days to plough a field , how long would it take 15 tractors ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "We can solve this problem using the formula:\n\n`number of days = (number of tractors * number of days) / amount of work`\n\nSince the amount of work is the same in both cases (ploughing the same field), we can set up the equation as follows:\n\n`(8 tractors * 12 days) / 1 = (15 tractors * x days) / 1`\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n`8 * 12 = 15 * x`\n\n`96 = 15 * x`\n\n`x = 6.4`\n\nTherefore, it would take 15 tractors 6.4 days to plough the same field. However, since the number of days must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, and the answer is:\n\nIt would take 15 tractors 7 days to plough the field."}

At what price should the retailer mark them so he can sell them at a 20 % discount off the selling price and still make 30 % profit on his cost ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "To make a 30% profit on the cost of $80 per pair, the selling price should be:\n\nSelling price = Cost + Profit\nSelling price = $80 + 0.30($80)\nSelling price = $80 + $24\nSelling price = $104\n\nNow, the retailer wants to sell them at a 20% discount off the selling price, so the new selling price should be:\n\nDiscounted price = Selling price - 0.20(Selling price)\nDiscounted price = $104 - 0.20($104)\nDiscounted price = $83.20\n\nTherefore, the retailer should mark the pants at $83.20 to sell them at a 20% discount off the selling price and still make a 30% profit on the cost."}
{"date_time": "11/03/2023 10:58:27", "question_number": 996, "question": "ana has $ 300 and ojo has $ 1860 . if ana saves $ 50 day and ojo spends $ 70 a day after how many days will they each have the same amount Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Let's start by setting up equations for Ana's and Ojo's savings over time.\n\nAfter n days, Ana will have saved:\n50n\n\nAfter n days, Ojo will have spent:\n-70n\n\nWe want to find out how many days it will take for their savings to be equal, so we can set these two equations equal to each other:\n\n50n = 1860 - 70n\n\nNow we can solve for n:\n\n50n + 70n = 1860\n\n120n = 1860\n\nn = 15.5\n\nSo it will take approximately 15.5 days for Ana and Ojo to have the same amount of money. However, since they are dealing with money, we should also consider rounding the number of days up to the nearest whole day to be safe. Therefore, it will take 16 days for them to have the same amount of money."}

There would had been equal number of boys and girls if there had been 3 more boys and 3 fewer girls . How many girls and boys are in a dance group ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Let's start by assigning variables to the unknowns in the problem. \n\nLet's use g to represent the number of girls and b to represent the number of boys.\n\nWe know from the problem that the ratio of girls to boys is 5 to 3, so we can set up the equation:\n\ng/b = 5/3\n\nWe also know that there would have been equal numbers of boys and girls if there had been 3 more boys and 3 fewer girls, so we can set up another equation:\n\n(g - 3)/(b + 3) = 1\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns. We can use algebra to solve for g and b.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the second equation by multiplying both sides by (b + 3):\n\ng - 3 = b + 3\n\nNext, let's solve for g in terms of b:\n\ng = b + 6\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for g into the first equation:\n\n(b + 6)/b = 5/3\n\nWe can cross-multiply to get:\n\n3(b + 6) = 5b\n\nSimplifying this equation gives:\n\n3b + 18 = 5b\n\nSubtracting 3b from both sides gives:\n\n18 = 2b\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\n\nb = 9\n\nSo there are 9 boys in the dance group.\n\nWe can use the equation g = b + 6 to find the number of girls:\n\ng = 9 + 6 = 15\n\nSo there are 15 girls in the dance group.\n\nTherefore, the dance group has 15 girls and 9 boys."}

Right before the work started , they received a new piece of machinery that helped them clean 10 more acres per day than originally planned . As a result of increased productivity in the last day before the deadline they only had to clean 30 acres . How many acres of wheat did the group of farmers have to clean ? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Let's call the number of days originally planned to clean the wheat 'x'. \n\nWe know that the group planned to clean 80 acres per day, so the total area of wheat to be cleaned without the new machinery would be: \n\n80 acres/day * x days = 80x acres\n\nWith the new machinery, they were able to clean 10 more acres per day, so their new cleaning rate was 80 + 10 = 90 acres per day. \n\nOn the last day, they only had to clean 30 acres, so we can set up an equation: \n\n80x - 90(x-1) = 30 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n80x - 90x + 90 = 30 \n\n-10x = -60 \n\nx = 6 \n\nSo the group of farmers originally planned to clean the wheat in 6 days, and they were supposed to clean: \n\n80 acres/day * 6 days = 480 acres \n\nBut with the new machinery, they could clean 90 acres per day, so they only needed: \n\n30 acres / 90 acres/day = 1/3 day \n\nto finish the job. \n\nTherefore, they had to clean: \n\n480 acres - 30 acres = 450 acres"}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Let's call the length of the shorter part of the wire 'x'. According to the problem, the longer part is 32 cm longer than the shorter part, so its length would be 'x + 32'.\n\nWe know that the total length of the wire is 180 cm, so we can set up an equation:\n\nx + (x + 32) = 180\n\nSimplifying this equation, we can combine like terms:\n\n2x + 32 = 180\n\nSubtracting 32 from both sides, we get:\n\n2x = 148\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nx = 74\n\nSo the shorter part of the wire is 74 cm long. To find the length of the longer part, we can use the equation we set up earlier:\n\nx + 32 = 74 + 32 = 106\n\nTherefore, the longer part of the wire is 106 cm long."}
