For example, we can solve for 'h' in terms of 'b':\n\nh = 30 - b\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n9b + 5(30 - b) = 190\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n4b + 150 = 190\n\nSubtracting 150 from both sides, we get:\n\n4b = 40\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\n\nb = 10\n\nSo there are 10 pairs of boots. Substituting this value back into the first equation, we get:\n\n10 + h = 30\n\nSo there are 20 hats."}

How many pounds of each should be mixed together in order to get a 320 pound mixture that is 15 % protein?", "response": "Let's start by using the method of 'alligation'.\n\nWe want to mix two ingredients with different concentrations to obtain a mixture with a desired concentration. We can think of the concentration as a weight, so that the problem reduces to a simple weighted average.\n\nFirst, let's set up a table to represent the concentration of each ingredient and the final mixture:\n\n```\n   |  %  |  lb |  %\n---+-----+-----+-----\nS  |  16 |  ?  | 15\nC  |   8 |  ?  |   \n---+-----+-----+-----\nM  |  15 | 320 |   \n```\n\nThe 'S' and 'C' represent soybean meal and cornmeal, respectively. We don't know the number of pounds of each ingredient yet, so we put a question mark in those cells. The concentration of the final mixture is given as 15%, and we know that the total weight of the mixture is 320 pounds.\n\nNext, we can use the method of alligation to find the ratio of soybean meal to cornmeal. To do this, we draw arrows connecting the two concentrations, and label the midpoint with the concentration of the final mixture:\n\n```\n   |  %  |  lb |  %\n---+-----+-----+-----\nS  |  16 |  ?  | 15\n   |     |     |   \nC  |   8 |  ?  |   \n---+-----+-----+-----\nM  |  15 | 320 |   \n   |     |     |   \n   |  12 |     |   \n```\n\nThe midpoint is (16-15) = (15-8) = 7 away from each concentration, so we put 7 on each arrow. The value at the midpoint is the concentration of the final mixture, which is 15.\n\nTo find the ratio of soybean meal to cornmeal, we add the weights on each side of the midpoint separately:\n\n```\n   |  %  |  lb |  %\n---+-----+-----+-----\nS  |  16 |  ?  | 15\n   |     |     |   \nC  |   8 |  ?  |   \n---+-----+-----+-----\nM  |  15 | 320 |   \n   |     |     |   \n   |  12 |     |   \n---+-----+-----+-----\n   |     |     |  24\n```\n\nThe total weight on the left side of the midpoint is 12, and the total weight on the right side is 24. Therefore, the ratio of soybean meal to cornmeal is 12:24, or 1:2.\n\nWe can use this ratio to find the weights of each ingredient:\n\n```\n   |  %  |  lb |  %\n---+-----+-----+-----\nS  |  16 |  ?  | 15\n   |     |     |   \nC  |   8 |  ?  |   \n---+-----+-----+-----\nM  |  15 | 320 |   \n   |     |     |   \n   |  12 |  24 |   \n---+-----+-----+-----\n   |     |     |  24\n```\n\nSince the ratio is 1:2, we can divide the total weight of the mixture (320) into three parts: one part soybean meal and two parts cornmeal. This gives us:\n\n```\n   |  %  |  lb |  %\n---+-----+-----+-----\nS  |  16 |  80 | 15\n   |     |"}

Let's say we remove x gallons of the current mixture.\n\nAfter removing x gallons, we will have 4 - x gallons of fluid remaining in the radiator, with 0.4 - 0.1x gallons of antifreeze.

Let's call the number of adult tickets sold 'a' and the number of kid tickets sold 'k'.\n\nWe know that the total number of tickets sold is 175, so:\n\na + k = 175\n\nWe also know that the profit was 750 dollars. We can express the profit as the revenue (the amount of money earned from ticket sales) minus the cost (the amount of money it took to produce the tickets). The revenue is the total number of tickets sold times the price of each ticket. So:\n\n6a + 2k = revenue\n6a + 2k = 750 + cost\n\nWe don't know the cost, but we can express it in terms of the number of tickets sold. We know that each adult ticket costs 4 dollars more to produce than a kid ticket (since adults pay 6 dollars and kids pay 2 dollars). So the total cost is:\n\ncost = 4a + 2k\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for 'cost' into the revenue equation:\n\n6a + 2k = 750 + 4a + 2k\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2a = 750 + 4k - 750\n\n2a = 4k\n\na = 2k\n\nWe also know that the total number of tickets sold is 175, so:\n\n2k + k = 175\n\n3k = 175\n\nk = 58.33 (rounded to the nearest hundredth)\n\nSince we can't sell a fraction of a ticket, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. So the number of kid tickets sold is 58.\n\nTo find the number of adult tickets sold, we can use the equation a + k = 175:\n\na + 58 = 175\n\na = 117\n\nTherefore, 117 adult tickets and 58 kid tickets were sold."}

We can write this as another equation:\n\n2a + 5o = 1.27   (equation 2)\n\nNow we can solve for a and o using a system of equations. One way to do this is to multiply equation 1 by 5 and subtract it from equation 2 multiplied by 3:\n\n(3)(2a + 5o) - (5)(6a + 3o) = (3)(1.27) - (5)(1.77)\n6a + 15o - 30a - 15o = 0.81 - 8.85\n-24a = -8.04\na = 0.335\n\nNow we can substitute this value of a into either equation 1 or equation 2 and solve for o.

We can solve for one of the variables in terms of the other and substitute into one of the equations to solve for the other variable. \n\nLet's solve for 'p' in terms of 't' by adding the two equations: \n\n(p + t) + (p - t) = 460 + 310 \n\n2p = 770 \n\np = 385 \n\nNow we can substitute this value of 'p' into one of the original equations to solve for 't': \n\np + t = 460 \n\n385 + t = 460 \n\nt = 75 \n\nTherefore, the speed of the tailwind is 75 miles per hour."}

He made a total of 11 shots. How many 3-point shots did he make? How many 2-point shots did he make? ", "response": "Let's assume that Will made x number of 3-point shots and y number of 2-point shots.\n\nFrom the given information, we can set up two equations:\n\nx + y = 11   (the total number of shots he made)\n3x + 2y = 26  (the total number of points he scored)\n\nWe can use the first equation to solve for x in terms of y:\n\nx = 11 - y\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n3(11 - y) + 2y = 26\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n33 - 3y + 2y = 26\n\ny = 7\n\nSo, Will made 7 2-point shots.\n\nSubstituting this value of y back into x + y = 11, we get:\n\nx + 7 = 11\n\nx = 4\n\nTherefore, Will made 4 3-point shots.\n\nSo, Will made 4 3-point shots and 7 2-point shots."}
{"date_time": "04/03/2023 02:31:06", "question_number": 511, "question": "At Al 's Rent-a-Center , it costs 30 dollars more per month to rent a leather couch than it does to rent a microfiber couch. Pauline rented a leather couch for 8 months and then exchanged it for a microfiber couch , which she rented for 12 months. She paid a total of 1620 dollars to rent these couches. Solve this system of equations to find the monthly rental charge for the leather couch , in dollars. Find the monthly rental charge for the microfiber couch. ", "response": "Let's start by assigning variables to the unknowns in the problem:\n\n- Let x be the monthly rental charge for the microfiber couch, in dollars.\n- Then, the monthly rental charge for the leather couch is x + 30, since it costs 30 dollars more per month.\n\nNow we can set up two equations based on the information given:\n\n- Pauline rented a leather couch for 8 months and then exchanged it for a microfiber couch, which she rented for 12 months. The total cost was 1620 dollars, so we have:\n   (x + 30) * 8 + x * 12 = 1620\n- We also know that x is the monthly rental charge for the microfiber couch, so we can write:\n   x = x\n\nSimplifying the first equation, we get:\n   8x + 240 + 12x = 1620\n   20x + 240 = 1620\n   20x = 1380\n   x = 69\n\nTherefore, the monthly rental charge for the microfiber couch is 69 dollars. To find the monthly rental charge for the leather couch, we can use the expression x + 30:\n   x + 30 = 69 + 30 = 99\n\nSo the monthly rental charge for the leather couch is 99 dollars."}
