If the total yearly interest from this investment is 256 dollars , how much did Pat invest at 10 percent and how much at 8 percent? ", "response": "\n\nLet's call the amount that Pat invested at 10 percent 'x' and the amount invested at 8 percent 'y'. \n\nWe know that Pat invested a total of 3,000 dollars, so we can write: \n\nx + y = 3000 \n\nWe also know that the yearly interest from the 10 percent investment is 10% of x, or 0.1x. Similarly, the yearly interest from the 8 percent investment is 8% of y, or 0.08y. We can write an equation for the total yearly interest: \n\n0.1x + 0.08y = 256 \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, so we can use substitution or elimination to solve for x and y. \n\nLet's use substitution. Rearranging the first equation, we can solve for x in terms of y: \n\nx = 3000 - y \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for x into the second equation: \n\n0.1(3000 - y) + 0.08y = 256 \n\nDistributing the 0.1: \n\n300 - 0.1y + 0.08y = 256 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n44 = 0.02y \n\nDividing by 0.02: \n\ny = 2200 \n\nSo Pat invested 2200 dollars at 8 percent. To find out how much was invested at 10 percent, we can use the first equation: \n\nx + y = 3000 \n\nx + 2200 = 3000 \n\nx = 800 \n\nTherefore, Pat invested 800 dollars at 10 percent and 2200 dollars at 8 percent."}

", "response": "\n\nLet's use the variables f and s to represent the number of floor seats and stadium seats sold, respectively.\n\nWe know that the total number of tickets sold was 200, so we can write this as:\n\nf + s = 200\n\nWe also know that the total revenue from ticket sales was 6080 dollars. We can write an equation for this by multiplying the number of floor seats sold by 36 dollars (the price of a floor seat) and the number of stadium seats sold by 28 dollars (the price of a stadium seat), and then adding these two values:\n\n36f + 28s = 6080\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns. We can use the first equation to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other:\n\nf + s = 200\n\ns = 200 - f\n\nWe can substitute this expression for s into the second equation:\n\n36f + 28s = 6080\n\n36f + 28(200 - f) = 6080\n\nExpanding the brackets and simplifying:\n\n36f + 5600 - 28f = 6080\n\n8f = 480\n\nf = 60\n\nSo the vendor sold 60 floor seat tickets. We can substitute this value back into the equation s = 200 - f to find the number of stadium seat tickets sold:\n\ns = 200 - f = 200 - 60 = 140\n\nTherefore, the vendor sold 60 floor seat tickets and 140 stadium seat tickets."}

We'll use A to represent the number of adult tickets sold and C to represent the number of children's tickets sold.\n\nA + C = 280   (the total number of people who attended the theater)\n0.6A + 0.25C = 140   (the total amount of money collected)\n\nNow we can solve for C. First, let's simplify the second equation by multiplying both sides by 100 to get rid of the decimals.\n\n60A + 25C = 14000\n\nNext, let's use the first equation to solve for A in terms of C:\n\nA = 280 - C\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for A into the second equation:\n\n60(280 - C) + 25C = 14000\n\nDistribute the 60:\n\n16800 - 60C + 25C = 14000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n16800 - 35C = 14000\n\nSubtract 16800 from both sides:\n\n-35C = -2800\n\nDivide both sides by -35:\n\nC = 80\n\nSo there were 80 children's tickets sold that day.

", "response": "\n\nLet's call the speed of the boat in still water 'b' and the speed of the current 'c'. \n\nWhen the boat is going upstream (against the current), it is going against the current, so its effective speed is b - c. \n\nWhen the boat is going downstream (with the current), it is going with the current, so its effective speed is b + c. \n\nWe know that the distance the boat travels in both cases is 45 miles. So we can use the formula: \n\ndistance = rate x time \n\nFor the upstream trip: \n\n45 = (b - c) x 5 \n\nFor the downstream trip: \n\n45 = (b + c) x 3 \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables.

", "response": "\n\nLet's start by assigning variables to represent the unknowns we are trying to solve for:\n\n- Let b be the cost of one bagel (in dollars)\n- Let c be the cost of one package of cream cheese (in dollars)\n\nWith these variables, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:\n\n- 2b + 3c = 12 (for Monday's meeting)\n- 4b + 2c = 14 (for Friday's meeting)\n\nWe can simplify these equations by dividing both sides by their common factors:\n\n- b + (3/2)c = 6 (for Monday's meeting)\n- 2b + c = 7 (for Friday's meeting)\n\nNow we can use either substitution or elimination to solve for one of the variables. Let's use elimination by multiplying the first equation by 2:\n\n- 2b + 3c = 12 (for Monday's meeting)\n- 4b + 2c = 14 (for Friday's meeting)\n- 4b + 3c = 24 (multiply first equation by 2)\n- -4b - 2c = -14 (subtract second equation from third)\n\nSimplifying this gives us:\n\nc = 10\n\nNow we can substitute this back into either of the original equations to solve for b.

Looking back at our equations, we can see that the problem is that we didn't simplify the fraction (3/2) in the first equation. Let's fix that and start over:\n\n- 2b + 3c = 12 (for Monday's meeting)\n- 4b + 2c = 14 (for Friday's meeting)\n- 4b + 6c = 24 (multiply first equation by 2)\n- -4b - 2c = -14 (subtract second equation from third)\n\nSimplifying this gives us:\n\n4c = 10\n\nc = 2.5\n\nNow we can substitute this back into either of the original equations to solve for b. Let's use the first one:\n\nb + (3/2)c = 6\n\nb + (3/2)(2.5) = 6\n\nb + 3.75 = 6\n\nb = 2.25\n\nTherefore, a bag of bagels costs 2.25 dollars and a package of cream cheese costs 2.5 dollars."}

That doesn't make sense! \n\nWhat it means is that we can't get the desired mixture by adding 100% antifreeze alone. We need to add some water to the 100% antifreeze to get the 20% mixture we want. \n\nTo figure out how much water we need to add, we can use the fact that the 10% antifreeze mixture has 10% antifreeze and 90% water: \n\n440 gallons of 10% mixture = 0.1(440) = 44 gallons of antifreeze \nso it has 396 gallons of water \n\nSo, the total amount of water we need in the final mixture is: \n\n55 gallons - 44 gallons of antifreeze = 11 gallons of antifreeze \n\nAnd since we need a 20% mixture, the ratio of antifreeze to total mixture is: \n\n11 / total mixture = 0.2 \n\nSolving for total mixture: \n\ntotal mixture = 55 gallons / 0.2 = 275 gallons \n\nSo we need to add 275 - 440 = -165 gallons of water. \n\nAgain, negative gallons means we can't get the exact mixture we want. In this case, we can only get to about 16% antifreeze if we mix 440 gallons of 10% antifreeze and -385 gallons of 100% antifreeze with enough water to bring the total volume up to 55 gallons. \n\nSo the garage owner needs to either adjust his requirements, or find a different way to mix his antifreeze."}

", "response": "\n\nLet's call the number of times he batted against left-handers 'L'. We know that he had a total of 600 at-bats, so:\n\nL + R = 600\n\nWe also know that his overall batting average was 0.320, which means he got a hit in 32% of his at-bats. Using this information, we can write:\n\n192/600 = 0.320\n\nSimplifying, we can divide both sides by 12:\n\n16/50 = 0.320\n\nNow we can use this to find the number of hits he got against left-handers and right-handers:\n\n0.250L + 0.350R = 16/50\n\nMultiplying both sides by 100 to get rid of decimals, we have:\n\n25L + 35R = 32\n\nNow we can use our equation system to solve for L:\n\nL + R = 600\n25L + 35R = 3200\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 25 to eliminate R, we get:\n\n25L + 25R = 15000\n\nSubtracting this from the second equation, we get:\n\n10R = 8800\n\nDividing by 10, we find that R = 880. We can plug this back into the first equation to find L:\n\nL + 880 = 600\n\nL = 600 - 880\n\nL = -280\n\nWait a minute -- a negative number of at-bats? That doesn't make sense. What went wrong?\n\nThe issue is that our equation system is inconsistent. We have one equation (the batting average) that gives us a relationship between the number of hits and at-bats, but that equation doesn't distinguish between left-handed and right-handed pitching. We have another equation (the one relating L and R to the total number of at-bats) that does distinguish between left-handed and right-handed pitching, but that equation doesn't give us any information about hitting.\n\nAs a result, we can't use these equations to find a unique solution for L and R. However, we can still make some observations. For example, we know that the player's overall batting average is closer to his average against right-handers (0.350) than his average against left-handers (0.250). This suggests that he faced right-handers more often than left-handers. We also know that he got 192 hits in total, so the maximum number of at-bats he could have had against left-handers is 192/0.250 = 768. This is more than his total number of at-bats (600), which means that he couldn't have faced left-handers for every at-bat.\n\nBased on these observations, we can conclude that the player faced left-handers fewer than 192 times, but we can't say exactly how many times. Without more information, we can't solve for L."}

Mrs. Jerrerson plans on spending 502 dollars on 14 meals and 4 nights in a hotel. Mrs. Lloyd plans on spending 370 dollars on 10 meals and 3 nights in a hotel. How much are they planning on spending per meal and per night for a hotel?", "response": "\n\nFirst, let's find the total cost per person for Mrs. Jefferson:\n\nTotal cost = cost of meals + cost of hotel\nTotal cost = 14 x cost per meal + 4 x cost per night in a hotel\nTotal cost = 14x + 4y\nwhere x is the cost per meal and y is the cost per night in a hotel.\n\nSimilarly, for Mrs. Lloyd:\n\nTotal cost = cost of meals + cost of hotel\nTotal cost = 10 x cost per meal + 3 x cost per night in a hotel\nTotal cost = 10x + 3y\n\nWe know that Mrs. Jefferson plans on spending 502 dollars and Mrs. Lloyd plans on spending 370 dollars, so we can set up two equations:\n\n14x + 4y = 502\n10x + 3y = 370\n\nWe can solve for x and y by using a system of equations. Multiplying the second equation by 4 and subtracting it from the first equation, we get:\n\n14x + 4y - (40x + 12y) = 502 - 1480\n-26x - 8y = -978\n13x + 4y = 489\n\nMultiplying the second equation by 3 and subtracting it from the first equation, we get:\n\n14x + 4y - (30x + 9y) = 502 - 1110\n-16x - 5y = -608\n16x + 5y = 608\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n\n13x + 4y = 489\n16x + 5y = 608\n\nSolving for y in terms of x in the first equation:\n\n4y = 489 - 13x\ny = (489 - 13x)/4\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n\n16x + 5((489 - 13x)/4) = 608\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n64x + 5(489 - 13x) = 2432\n64x + 2445 - 65x = 2432\n-x = -13\nx = 13\n\nSo the cost per meal is 13 dollars. Plugging this into either equation to solve for y:\n\n13x + 4y = 489\n13(13) + 4y = 489\ny = 99/4\n\nSo the cost per night in a hotel is 24.75 dollars. Therefore, Mrs. Jefferson plans on spending approximately 13 dollars per meal and 24.75 dollars per night in a hotel, while Mrs. Lloyd plans on spending approximately 12.33 dollars per meal and 23.33 dollars per night in a hotel."}

First, let's rearrange the first equation to solve for one of the variables. Let's solve for y:\n\ny = 12,000 - x\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for y into the second equation and solve for x:\n\n0.075x + 0.06(12,000-x) = 840\n\n0.075x + 720 - 0.06x = 840\n\n0.015x = 120\n\nx = 8,000\n\nSo Didi invested $8,000 in the 7.5% account.

Find the number.", "response": "\n\nLet's call the number we are trying to find 'x'.\nAccording to the problem, 'twice the number' is 2x.\nThe problem states that the sum of 38 and twice the number is 124, so we can write an equation: \n\n38 + 2x = 124 \n\nTo solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. \n\nSubtracting 38 from both sides: \n\n2x = 86 \n\nDividing both sides by 2: \n\nx = 43 \n\nTherefore, the number we are trying to find is 43."}
