How many novelists are there? How many poets are there? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Determine the total ratio\n\nThe ratio of novelists to poets is 5:3. This means that for every 5 novelists, there are 3 poets. We can add these two numbers to get the total ratio:\n\n5 + 3 = 8\n\nSo the total ratio is 8.\n\nStep 2: Divide the total number of people by the total ratio\n\nWe know that there are 24 people at the workshop. We can divide this number by the total ratio to find out how many people correspond to each unit of the ratio:\n\n24 / 8 = 3\n\nSo each unit of the ratio corresponds to 3 people.\n\nStep 3: Multiply the number of units by the ratio to find the number of novelists and poets\n\nWe know that there are 5 units of novelists for every 8 units of the total ratio. We can multiply 5 by 3 (the number of people per unit of the ratio) to find out how many novelists there are:\n\n5 units x 3 people per unit = 15 novelists\n\nSimilarly, we can multiply 3 (the number of units of poets) by 3 (the number of people per unit of the ratio) to find out how many poets there are:\n\n3 units x 3 people per unit = 9 poets\n\nTherefore, there are 15 novelists and 9 poets at the workshop."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Let's use 'b' to represent the speed of the bird without wind and 'w' to represent the speed of the wind.\n\nWhen the bird is flying with the wind, the effective speed is the sum of the speed of the bird and the speed of the wind, so:\n\nb + w = 150\n\nWhen the bird is flying against the wind, the effective speed is the difference between the speed of the bird and the speed of the wind, so:\n\nb - 0.5w = 30\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns, so we can solve for b and w. We can start by solving for b in terms of w from the first equation:\n\nb = 150 - w\n\nWe can substitute this expression for b into the second equation:\n\n(150 - w) - 0.5w = 30\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n150 - 1.5w = 30\n\n-1.5w = -120\n\nw = 80\n\nNow that we know the speed of the wind, we can substitute this value into either of the original equations to solve for the speed of the bird:\n\nb + 80 = 150\n\nb = 70\n\nTherefore, the velocity of the wind is 80 kilometers per hour, and the velocity of the bird is 70 kilometers per hour."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the information given to us and set up an equation to solve for the number of overtime hours worked.\n\nLet's start by defining some variables:\n- Let x be the number of ordinary hours worked\n- Let y be the number of overtime hours worked\n\nWe know that the worker gets paid 60 cents an hour for ordinary time, so the amount she earns for ordinary hours is 0.6x dollars. Similarly, she gets paid 90 cents an hour for overtime, so the amount she earns for overtime hours is 0.9y dollars.\n\nWe also know that she earned a total of $32.40 for the week. Since she worked 50 hours, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.6x + 0.9y = 32.40\n\nThis equation represents the total amount of money earned for the week, based on the number of ordinary and overtime hours worked.\n\nWe want to solve for y, the number of overtime hours worked. To do this, we need to isolate y on one side of the equation. We can start by subtracting 0.6x from both sides:\n\n0.9y = 32.40 - 0.6x\n\nNow we can divide both sides by 0.9:\n\ny = (32.40 - 0.6x) / 0.9\n\nThis gives us the equation for y, in terms of x. We can use this equation to solve for y, given a value of x.\n\nBut we still don't know the value of x. We know that the worker worked a total of 50 hours, so we can set up another equation:\n\nx + y = 50\n\nThis equation represents the total number of hours worked for the week, based on the number of ordinary and overtime hours worked.\n\nWe can use these two equations together to solve for x and y. We'll start by solving for x in terms of y, using the second equation:\n\nx = 50 - y\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for x into the first equation:\n\n0.6(50 - y) + 0.9y = 32.40\n\nSimplifying and solving for y, we get:\n\n30 - 0.6y + 0.9y = 32.40\n0.3y = 2.40\ny = 8\n\nSo the worker worked 8 overtime hours. We can use the second equation to find the number of ordinary hours:\n\nx + y = 50\nx + 8 = 50\nx = 42\n\nSo the worker worked 42 ordinary hours and 8 overtime hours."}

Let's call the rate of the boat in still water 'b' (i.e., the rate of the boat when there is no current), and let's call the rate of the current 'c'.\n\nWhen the boat is traveling downstream (i.e., with the current), its effective speed is the sum of its speed in still water and the speed of the current. So, we can write:\n\nEffective speed downstream = b + c\n\nWhen the boat is traveling upstream (i.e., against the current), its effective speed is the difference between its speed in still water and the speed of the current. So, we can write:\n\nEffective speed upstream = b - c\n\nNow, let's use the information we have to set up some equations.\n\nWe know that the boat travels 24 miles downstream in 4 hours. So, we can write:\n\n24 = (b + c) * 4\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n6 = b + c\n\nSimilarly, we know that the boat travels 24 miles upstream in 6 hours. So, we can write:\n\n24 = (b - c) * 6\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n4 = b - c\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n6 = b + c\n\n4 = b - c\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of 'b' and 'c'. One way to do this is to add the two equations:\n\n6 + 4 = b + c + b - c\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n10 = 2b\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nb = 5\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of 'b' into one of our original equations to find the value of 'c'. Let's use the equation:\n\n6 = b + c\n\nSubstituting b = 5, we get:\n\n6 = 5 + c\n\nSubtracting 5 from both sides, we get:\n\n1 = c\n\nSo, the rate of the current in the river is 1 mile per hour."}

We know that you bought a total of 25 boxes, so we can write:\n\nx + y = 25\n\nWe also know that the total cost was $28.00. The cost of a box of peppermint candy is $1.00, so the total cost of the peppermint candy is x * $1.00 = $x. The cost of a box of candy canes is $1.30, so the total cost of the candy canes is y * $1.30 = $1.30y. Therefore, we can write another equation:\n\nx + 1.30y = 28.00\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (x and y).

We know that Jerome bought a total of 12 CDs, so x + y = 12. We also know that he spent a total of 82 dollars, so:\n\n7.5x + 6.5y = 82\n\nNow we can use substitution or elimination to solve for x and y. Let's use substitution. From the equation x + y = 12, we can solve for x in terms of y by subtracting y from both sides:\n\nx = 12 - y\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for x in the second equation:\n\n7.5(12 - y) + 6.5y = 82\n\nSimplifying:\n\n90 - 7.5y + 6.5y = 82\n\n-y = -8\n\ny = 8\n\nSo Jerome bought 8 CDs that cost 6.50 dollars each.

Therefore, the combined speed of the two automobiles is:\n\nx + (x+10) = 2x + 10\n\nWe also know that they travel a total of 600 kilometers before they meet. We can use the formula distance = rate x time to set up two equations:\n\nDistance traveled by the westbound automobile = x * 5\n\nDistance traveled by the eastbound automobile = (x+10) * 5\n\nThe sum of these two distances is 600:\n\nx * 5 + (x+10) * 5 = 600\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\n5x + 5(x+10) = 600\n\n10x + 50 = 600\n\n10x = 550\n\nx = 55\n\nSo the speed of the westbound automobile is 55 kilometers per hour, and the speed of the eastbound automobile is x+10 = 65 kilometers per hour.\n\nTherefore, the average speed of each automobile is (55 + 65)/2 = 60 kilometers per hour."}

Let's solve the first equation for tax:\n\ntax = 7.80 - 2t - 3e\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for tax into the second equation:\n\n3t + 5e + (7.80 - 2t - 3e) = 12.70\n\nSimplifying and solving for t:\n\nt + 2e = 4.90\nt - e = 0.98\nt = e + 0.98\n\nSubstituting back into the first equation and solving for e:\n\n2t + 3e + tax = 7.80\n2(e + 0.98) + 3e + (7.80 - 2(e + 0.98) - 3e) = 7.80\n2e + 1.96 + 3e + (7.80 - 2e - 1.96 - 3e) = 7.80\n5e + 3.84 = 7.80\n5e = 3.96\ne = 0.792\n\nNow we can use the equation t = e + 0.98 to solve for t:\n\nt = e + 0.98\nt = 0.792 + 0.98\nt = 1.772\n\nSo each taco costs 1.772 dollars and each enchilada costs 0.792 dollars."}
