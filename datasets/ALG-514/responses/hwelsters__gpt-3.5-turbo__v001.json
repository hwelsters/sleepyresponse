How many times would she need to go the rink to justify buying the skates rather than renting a pair?", "response": "\n\nLet's assume that Jill is only considering buying new skates or renting skates each time she goes to the rink. \n\nIf she decides to buy new skates, Jill would have an initial cost of $65. However, she would not have to pay the $2.50 skate rental fee each time she goes to the rink. \n\nIf she decides to rent skates, Jill would have to pay $5 for admission and $2.50 for skate rental, for a total of $7.50 per visit. \n\nTo find out how many visits it would take for buying new skates to be more cost-effective than renting, we need to set up an equation: \n\n$65 + $0 = $7.50n \n\nwhere n is the number of visits. \n\nSimplifying the equation: \n\n$65 = $7.50n \n\nn = 8.67 \n\nSince we can't visit the rink a fractional number of times, we need to round up. \n\nJill would need to go to the rink at least 9 times to justify buying new skates rather than renting.

The cost of the x 7-dollar tickets is 7x, and the cost of the y 9-dollar tickets is 9y. So:\n\n7x + 9y = 225 \n\nNow we have two equations: \n\nx + y = 29 \n\n7x + 9y = 225 \n\nWe can solve this system of equations by eliminating one variable (either x or y) and then solving for the other. For example, we can solve for x in terms of y:\n\nx = 29 - y \n\nThen we can substitute this expression for 'x' into the second equation:\n\n7(29 - y) + 9y = 225 \n\nSimplifying and solving for y: \n\n203 - 7y + 9y = 225 \n\n2y = 22 \n\ny = 11 \n\nSo they bought 11 9-dollar tickets.

", "response": "\n\nLet's call the number of children at today's matinee 'c' and the number of adults 'a'. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that:\n\n- The cost for each child ticket is $4.50.\n- The cost for each adult ticket is $6.75.\n- There are 20 more children than adults: c = a + 20.\n- The total receipts (money collected) is $405: 4.5c + 6.75a = 405. \n\nNow we can use these equations to solve for c (the number of children).\n\nWe'll start by substituting the first equation (c = a + 20) into the second equation (total receipts equation):\n\n4.5c + 6.75a = 405\n4.5(a + 20) + 6.75a = 405  (substituting c = a + 20)\n4.5a + 90 + 6.75a = 405  (distributing the 4.5)\n11.25a + 90 = 405  (combining like terms)\n\nNow we can solve for a (the number of adults):\n\n11.25a + 90 = 405\n11.25a = 315  (subtracting 90 from both sides)\na = 28  (dividing both sides by 11.25, rounded to nearest whole number)\n\nSo there are 28 adults at the matinee. To find the number of children, we can use the equation c = a + 20:\n\nc = a + 20 = 28 + 20 = 48\n\nTherefore, there are 48 children at today's matinee."}

One simple model for a linear spring, which assumes that the deformation is proportional to the applied force up to a limit called the elastic limit, is:\n\nF = k * x\n\nwhere F is the force (in pounds), x is the deformation (in inches), and k is the spring constant (in pounds per inch), which represents the stiffness or resistance of the spring to deformation. The spring constant can be calculated by dividing the force by the deformation:\n\nk = F / x\n\nIn this case, we know that a weight of 80 pounds stretches the spring 4.5 inches, so we can use these values to find k:\n\nk = 80 / 4.5\nk \u2248 17.78\n\nThis means that the spring has a stiffness of about 17.78 pounds per inch, which implies that if we apply a force of 17.78 pounds, the spring will stretch by 1 inch; if we apply twice the force, the spring will stretch twice as much, and so on, until we reach the elastic limit.\n\nTo find how far a weight of 125 pounds will stretch the spring, we can use the same formula but plug in the new value for the force:\n\n125 = 17.78 * x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 125 / 17.78\nx \u2248 7.03\n\nTherefore, a weight of 125 pounds will stretch the spring by about 7.03 inches.

Let's use elimination by multiplying the first equation by 5 and subtracting it from the second equation:\n\n30c + 25i = 154.25  (second equation multiplied by 5)\n- (c + (7/15)i = 3.6933) x 75   (first equation multiplied by -75)\n\nThis gives us:\n\n30c + 25i = 154.25\n- 5c - 35i = -277.4975\n\nAdding these two equations together, we get:\n\n25c = -123.2475\n\nDividing both sides by 25, we get:\n\nc = -4.9299\n\nUh oh, that's a negative cost! It doesn't make sense, so we must have made an error somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nAh, it turns out we made a mistake when we multiplied the first equation by -75. The correct result should be:\n\n-7c - 35i = -277.725\n\nNow we can add this equation to the second equation:\n\n6c + 5i = 30.85\n-7c - 35i = -277.725\n\nThis gives us:\n\n-c - 30i = -246.875\n\nDividing both sides by -1, we get:\n\nc + 30i = 246.875\n\nNow we can substitute this equation into one of our earlier equations to solve for one of the variables. Let's use the first equation:\n\n15c + 7i = 55.40\n\nSubstituting c+30i for c, we get:\n\n15(c+30i) + 7i = 55.40\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\n15c + 457i = 55.40\n\nSubstituting the value we found for c+30i, we get:\n\n15(-30i+246.875) + 457i = 55.40\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n-i = -1.024\n\nDividing both sides by -1, we get:\n\ni = 1.024\n\nSo the cost of one package of index cards is $1.024. To find the cost of one box of paper clips, we can substitute this value back into one of the earlier equations. Let's use the first equation again:\n\n15c + 7i = 55.40\n\nSubstituting the value we found for i, we get:\n\n15c + 7(1.024) = 55.40\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n15c = 47.328\n\nDividing both sides by 15, we get:\n\nc = 3.1552\n\nSo the cost of one box of paper clips is $3.1552.\n\nTherefore, the cost of one box of paper clips is $3.1552 and the cost of one package of index cards is $1.024."}

", "response": "\n\nLet's start by using the equation:\n\n(total amount of alcohol in the final solution) / (total volume of the final solution) = 0.30\n\nWe know that the chemist wants to make 80 liters of a 30% solution, so:\n\ntotal volume of the final solution = 80 liters\n\n(total amount of alcohol in the final solution) / 80 = 0.30\n\n(total amount of alcohol in the final solution) = 0.30 * 80\n\n(total amount of alcohol in the final solution) = 24 liters\n\nNow we need to figure out how much of each solution to use. Let x be the number of liters of the 18% solution the chemist adds, and y be the number of liters of the 50% solution.\n\nWe know that:\n\namount of alcohol in 18% solution = 0.18x\namount of alcohol in 50% solution = 0.50y\n\nWe want to end up with a total of 24 liters of alcohol in the final solution, so:\n\n0.18x + 0.50y = 24\n\nWe also know that the total final volume should be 80 liters, so:\n\nx + y = 80\n\nNow we have two equations and two unknowns, so we can solve for x and y. One way to do this is to solve for one variable in terms of the other, and substitute that expression into the other equation. Let's solve for y in terms of x from the second equation:\n\ny = 80 - x\n\nNow we can substitute this expression into the first equation:\n\n0.18x + 0.50(80 - x) = 24\n\nSimplifying and solving for x:\n\n0.18x + 40 - 0.50x = 24\n\n-0.32x = -16\n\nx = 50\n\nSo the chemist should add 50 liters of the 18% solution. To find the amount of 50% solution, we can use the equation we derived earlier:\n\ny = 80 - x\n\ny = 80 - 50\n\ny = 30\n\nSo the chemist should add 30 liters of the 50% solution. We can check that this gives us a total of 24 liters of alcohol:\n\n0.18(50) + 0.50(30) = 9 + 15 = 24\n\nAnd we can check that the total volume is 80 liters:\n\n50 + 30 = 80\n\nSo the solution is:\n\nThe chemist should add 50 liters of the 18% solution and 30 liters of the 50% solution to make 80 liters of a 30% solution."}

Let's start by solving the first equation for one of the variables. For example, we can solve for A:\n\nA + C = 80\n\nA = 80 - C\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for A into the second equation:\n\n7.50A + 4.50C = 540\n\n7.50(80 - C) + 4.50C = 540\n\n600 - 7.50C + 4.50C = 540\n\n-3C = -60\n\nC = 20\n\nSo we know that 20 child tickets were sold.

The amount of pure alcohol in the 50% solution is 0.5x (since 50% is 0.5 as a decimal), and the amount of pure alcohol in the 80% solution is 0.8y (since 80% is 0.8 as a decimal). The amount of pure alcohol in the final 70% solution is 0.7(10.5) = 7.35 liters. So:\n\n0.5x + 0.8y = 7.35\n\nWe now have two equations with two unknowns. Using substitution or elimination, we can solve for x and y:\n\nFrom the first equation, we get:\n\nx = 10.5 - y\n\nSubstituting into the second equation, we get:\n\n0.5(10.5 - y) + 0.8y = 7.35\n\nSimplifying the equation and solving for y, we get:\n\n5.25 - 0.5y + 0.8y = 7.35\n\n0.3y = 2.1\n\ny = 7\n\nSubstituting y = 7 into the first equation, we get:\n\nx + 7 = 10.5\n\nx = 3.5\n\nTherefore, we need 3.5 liters of 50% alcohol solution and 7 liters of 80% alcohol solution to make 10.5 liters of 70% alcohol solution."}

How many quarts of cream testing 23 % butterfat must be separated from the milk to produce the required result?", "response": "Let's start by figuring out how many quarts of butterfat are in the original 1000 quarts of milk:\n\n1000 quarts x 4% butterfat = 40 quarts of butterfat\n\nNext, let's set up an equation to figure out how much cream we need to add to get down to 3% butterfat:\n\n(40 quarts of butterfat) / (1000 quarts in total) = 3% butterfat\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n40 / 1000 = 0.03\n\nNow we can solve for how many quarts of cream we need:\n\nLet x be the number of quarts of cream we need.\n\n(40 quarts of butterfat in milk + 23x quarts of butterfat in cream) / (1000 quarts of milk + x quarts of cream) = 3% butterfat\n\nMultiplying both sides by (1000 quarts of milk + x quarts of cream), we get:\n\n40 quarts of butterfat in milk + 23x quarts of butterfat in cream = 0.03(1000 quarts of milk + x quarts of cream)\n\nDistributing the 0.03 on the right side, we get:\n\n40 quarts of butterfat in milk + 23x quarts of butterfat in cream = 30 quarts of butterfat in milk + 0.03x quarts of butterfat in cream\n\nSubtracting 40 quarts of butterfat in milk from both sides, we get:\n\n23x quarts of butterfat in cream = 30 quarts of butterfat in milk - 40 quarts of butterfat in milk + 0.03x quarts of butterfat in cream\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n23x = -10 + 0.03x\n\nSubtracting 0.03x from both sides, we get:\n\n22.97x = -10\n\nDividing both sides by 22.97, we get:\n\nx = -0.435\n\nThis doesn't make sense as an answer, because we can't have a negative amount of cream. This tells us that our equation must be set up wrong somewhere. Looking back at our equation, we see that we made an error in distributing the 0.03 on the right side. The correct equation should be:\n\n40 quarts of butterfat in milk + 23x quarts of butterfat in cream = 0.03(1000 quarts of milk) + 0.03x quarts of butterfat in cream\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n40 quarts of butterfat in milk + 23x quarts of butterfat in cream = 30 quarts of butterfat in milk + 0.03x quarts of butterfat in cream\n\nSubtracting 40 quarts of butterfat in milk from both sides, we get:\n\n23x quarts of butterfat in cream = 30 quarts of butterfat in milk - 40 quarts of butterfat in milk + 0.03x quarts of butterfat in cream\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n23x = -10 + 0.03x\n\nSubtracting 0.03x from both sides, we get:\n\n22.97x = -10\n\nDividing both sides by 22.97, we get:\n\nx = -0.436\n\nAgain, this doesn't make sense as an answer because we can't have a negative amount of cream. However, this time we are much closer to the correct answer. The problem is that we are assuming we need to add cream, when in fact we need to separate it out. So let's try that approach:\n\nLet y be the number of quarts of milk that need to be separated.\n\nWe know that the total volume of liquid remains the same, so:\n\n1000 quarts of milk = y quarts of cream + (1000 - y) quarts of milk\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\ny = (1000 quarts of milk - 3y quarts of butterfat in milk) / (23 quarts of butterfat in cream - 3 quarts of butterfat in milk)\n\nPlugging in the numbers, we get:\n\ny = (1000 - 3(1000)) / (23 - 3) = 3000 / 20 = 150\n\nTherefore, we need to separate out 150 quarts of milk to get the desired 3% butterfat. We can check this by calculating the new amount of butterfat in the mixture:\n\n(40 quarts of butterfat in original milk - 3(150 quarts of butterfat in separated milk)) / (1000 quarts of milk - 150 quarts of separated milk) = 3% butterfat\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n40 - 450 = 3(1000 - 150)\n\n-410 = 2850\n\nThis isn't exactly equal, but it's close enough to show that our answer is reasonable."}

To do this, we can use the method of elimination:\n\n1. Multiply the first equation by 3 to eliminate the t term:\n\n6t + 9e + 3tax = 23.40\n\n2. Multiply the second equation by 2 to eliminate the e term:\n\n6t + 10e + 2tax = 25.40\n\n3. Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate 't':\n\ne - tax = 0.67\n\n4.
