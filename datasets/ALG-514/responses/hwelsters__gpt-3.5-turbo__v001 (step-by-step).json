How many novelists are there? How many poets are there? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Determine the ratio of novelists to poets. \n\nThe ratio of novelists to poets is 5 to 3. This means that for every 5 novelists, there are 3 poets in the workshop. \n\nStep 2: Use the ratio to set up an equation. \n\nLet's use 'n' to represent the number of novelists and 'p' to represent the number of poets. We know that the ratio of novelists to poets is 5 to 3, so we can set up the following equation: \n\nn/p = 5/3 \n\nStep 3: Use algebra to solve for one of the variables. \n\nWe can cross-multiply the equation to get: \n\n3n = 5p \n\nThen we can isolate one of the variables by dividing both sides by either 3 or 5: \n\nn = (5/3)p or p = (3/5)n \n\nStep 4: Use the total number of people to find the values of n and p. \n\nWe know that there are a total of 24 people at the workshop. We also know that the number of novelists and poets must add up to 24. \n\nLet's use the equation n + p = 24 to solve for the values of n and p. \n\nSubstituting the expression for p from step 3, we get: \n\nn + (3/5)n = 24 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 5: \n\n5n + 3n = 120 \n\n8n = 120 \n\nn = 15 \n\nSo there are 15 novelists at the workshop. \n\nUsing the equation n + p = 24, we can find the number of poets: \n\n15 + p = 24 \n\np = 9 \n\nSo there are 9 poets at the workshop. \n\nTherefore, there are 15 novelists and 9 poets at the workshop."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nLet's start by defining our variables:\n\n- Let's call the number of adult tickets sold 'a'\n- Let's call the number of child tickets sold 'c'\n\nWe know that there were 23 people at the performance, so we can write an equation based on that:\n\na + c = 23\n\nWe also know that the theater collected $246 from ticket sales, so we can write an equation based on that:\n\n11a + 10c = 246\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables. We can use substitution or elimination to solve for a and c.\n\nLet's use substitution. We can solve the first equation for a:\n\na = 23 - c\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for a in the second equation:\n\n11(23 - c) + 10c = 246\n\nSimplifying this equation gives:\n\n253 - 11c + 10c = 246\n\n-c = -7\n\nc = 7\n\nSo there were 7 child tickets sold. We can use the first equation to find the number of adult tickets sold:\n\na + c = 23\na + 7 = 23\na = 16\n\nSo there were 16 adult tickets sold.\n\nFinal answer: There were 7 children and 16 adults at the performance."}

How many wins and losses did the team have?  Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Determine the total number of games the Kings lost.\n\nSince we know that the Kings won two less than three times as many games as they lost, we can set up an equation:\n\nWins = 3 x Losses - 2\n\nWe also know that they played 82 games, so we can set up another equation:\n\nWins + Losses = 82\n\nWe can use substitution to solve for either variable. Let's solve for Losses:\n\nWins = 3 x Losses - 2\nWins + Losses = 82\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation:\n\n(3 x Losses - 2) + Losses = 82\n\nSimplifying:\n\n4 x Losses - 2 = 82\n\n4 x Losses = 84\n\nLosses = 21\n\nSo the Kings lost 21 games.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total number of games the Kings won.\n\nWe know that Wins + Losses = 82, and we just found that the Kings lost 21 games. Therefore:\n\nWins + 21 = 82\n\nWins = 61\n\nSo the Kings won 61 games.\n\nStep 3: Check our answer.\n\nWe can verify that our answer is correct by checking that the Kings won two less than three times as many games as they lost:\n\nWins = 3 x Losses - 2\n61 = 3 x 21 - 2\n61 = 63 - 2\n61 = 61\n\nOur answer checks out, so the Kings had 61 wins and 21 losses."}

You must report the number of hot dogs and sodas sold. How many hot dogs and sodas were sold? Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\n1. First, we need to set up equations to represent the given information. Let's use 'h' to represent the number of hot dogs sold, and 's' to represent the number of sodas sold. \n\n2.

This can be done by finding the difference between their individual speeds:\n\nRelative speed = Sharon's speed - Mary's speed\nRelative speed = 6 mph - 4 mph\nRelative speed = 2 mph\n\nThis means that the distance between Mary and Sharon is changing by 2 miles every hour.\n\nStep 2: Set up the equation to solve for time\nThe distance between Mary and Sharon is decreasing by 2 miles per hour. We need to find out how long it will take for them to be 3 miles apart. Let's call the amount of time it takes t, in hours.\n\nWhen they are 3 miles apart, Mary and Sharon will have travelled a total distance of 3 miles. We can represent this in an equation:\n\nDistance Mary travels + Distance Sharon travels = 3 miles\n\nWe can use the formula Distance = Speed * Time to find the distance each person travels:\n\nDistance Mary travels = Mary's speed * t\nDistance Sharon travels = Sharon's speed * t\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\nMary's speed * t + Sharon's speed * t = 3 miles\n\nStep 3: Solve for time\nNow we can simplify the equation and solve for t:\n\n4 mph * t + 6 mph * t = 3 miles\n10 mph * t = 3 miles\nt = 0.3 hours\n\nTherefore, it will take Mary and Sharon 0.3 hours, or 18 minutes, to be 3 miles apart."}

Let's use the variables p and e to represent the number of cartons of pencils and erasers, respectively. We know that the cost of a carton of pencils is 6 dollars, so the total cost of p cartons of pencils is 6p dollars. Similarly, the cost of a carton of erasers is 3 dollars, so the total cost of e cartons of erasers is 3e dollars. Finally, we know that the total order cost is 360 dollars, so we can set up the equation:\n\n6p + 3e = 360\n\nNext, we need to use the fact that the order is for a total of 100 cartons to set up another equation. Since p and e represent the number of cartons of pencils and erasers, respectively, we know that p + e = 100. We can use this equation to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other:\n\np = 100 - e\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for p into the first equation we set up:\n\n6(100 - e) + 3e = 360\n\nSimplifying and solving for e:\n\n600 - 6e + 3e = 360\n-3e = -240\ne = 80\n\nSo there were 80 cartons of erasers in the order.

For example, we can solve for x in terms of y from the first equation:\n\nx = 150 - y\n\nStep 5: Substituting this expression for x into the second equation, we get:\n\n(150 - y) - 0.5y = 30\n\nSimplifying and solving for y, we get:\n\ny = 80\n\nStep 6: Now that we know the wind's speed is 80 km/h, we can substitute this value into either equation to find x. For example, using the first equation:\n\nx + 80 = 150\n\nx = 70\n\nStep 7: Thus, the velocity of the wind is 80 kilometers per hour, and the velocity of the bird (without wind) is 70 kilometers per hour."}

We are told that:\n\n- We want to get a total of 20 liters of the mixture.\n- The final concentration of acid in the mixture should be 72%.\n- The first solution is 60% acid and the second solution is 75% acid.\n\nStep 2: Write down the equation relating the concentrations and volumes\n\nThe equation that relates the concentrations and volumes of the two solutions is:\n\n0.6x + 0.75y = 0.72(20)\n\nThis equation says that the amount of acid in the first solution (0.6x) plus the amount of acid in the second solution (0.75y) should be equal to the total amount of acid in the final mixture (0.72(20), which is the product of the concentration 0.72 and the volume 20).\n\nStep 3: Simplify the equation\n\nMultiplying out the right-hand side gives:\n\n0.6x + 0.75y = 14.4\n\nStep 4: Use the fact that x + y = 20 to eliminate one variable\n\nWe know that the total volume of the mixture is 20 liters, so we can write:\n\nx + y = 20\n\nSolving for one of the variables (say, y) gives:\n\ny = 20 - x\n\nWe can substitute this expression for y into the equation from Step 3 and get an equation involving only x:\n\n0.6x + 0.75(20 - x) = 14.4\n\nSimplifying this equation gives:\n\n0.15x + 15 = 14.4\n\nSubtracting 15 from both sides gives:\n\n0.15x = -0.6\n\nDividing both sides by 0.15 gives:\n\nx = -4\n\nUh oh, we got a negative value for x! What does it mean?\n\nStep 5: Check for extraneous solutions\n\nIn some cases, solving an equation may give us 'solutions' that do not make sense in the original context. These solutions are called extraneous solutions.\n\nIn our case, we cannot have a negative volume of the 60% acid solution, so the solution x = -4 is extraneous. This means that the original equation has no solution that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nStep 6: Conclusion\n\nWe cannot mix a 60% acid solution with a 75% acid solution to get a 20-liter solution that is 72% acid. In real life, this would mean that we need to adjust the concentrations or volumes of the solutions to make the problem solvable."}

Model A takes 4 hours to produce and costs 8 dollars each. Model B takes 3 hours to produce and costs 7 dollars each. If the manufacturer allots a total of 5800 hours and 12,600 dollars for production each week , how many of each model will be produced?  Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of Model A that can be produced with the allotted time and money\n\nTo produce one unit of Model A, it takes 4 hours and costs 8 dollars. Therefore, the number of units of Model A that can be produced with the allotted time and money can be calculated as follows:\n\nNumber of Model A = (Total time allotted / Time to produce one unit) * (Total money allotted / Cost to produce one unit)\nNumber of Model A = (5800 / 4) * (12600 / 8)\nNumber of Model A = 10150\n\nTherefore, the manufacturer can produce 10150 units of Model A with the allotted time and money.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of Model B that can be produced with the remaining time and money\n\nAfter producing 10150 units of Model A, there is a remaining time of 5800 - (10150 * 4) =2200 hours and a remaining money of 12600 - (10150 * 8) = 4300 dollars.\n\nTo produce one unit of Model B, it takes 3 hours and costs 7 dollars. Therefore, the number of units of Model B that can be produced with the remaining time and money can be calculated as follows:\n\nNumber of Model B = (Remaining time / Time to produce one unit) * (Remaining money / Cost to produce one unit)\nNumber of Model B = (2200 / 3) * (4300 / 7)\nNumber of Model B = 4422.86 (rounded down to 4422)\n\nTherefore, the manufacturer can produce 4422 units of Model B with the remaining time and money.\n\nStep 3: Check if the total cost and time do not exceed the allotted amounts\n\nTo check if the total cost and time do not exceed the allotted amounts, we can calculate the total cost and time for the produced units of Model A and Model B as follows:\n\nTotal cost = (Number of Model A * Cost to produce one unit of Model A) + (Number of Model B * Cost to produce one unit of Model B)\nTotal cost = (10150 * 8) + (4422 * 7)\nTotal cost = 125232 dollars\n\nTotal time = (Number of Model A * Time to produce one unit of Model A) + (Number of Model B * Time to produce one unit of Model B)\nTotal time = (10150 * 4) + (4422 * 3)\nTotal time = 58008 hours\n\nAs we can see, the total cost and time do not exceed the allotted amounts. Therefore, the production plan is feasible.\n\nStep 4: Write the final answer\n\nThe manufacturer will produce 10150 units of Model A and 4422 units of Model B to stay within the given cost and time constraints."}

On a certain day , 278 people entered the park.  On that same day the admission fees collected totaled 792 dollars. How many children were admitted on that day? How many adults were admitted?  Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\n1. We can start by using algebra to set up two equations using the given information. Let c be the number of children and a be the number of adults admitted on that day. Then we have:\n\nc + a = 278    (because the total number of people admitted is the sum of children and adults)\n1.5c + 4a = 792  (because the total admission fee collected is the sum of the products of the number of people and their respective ticket prices)\n\n2. We can use the first equation to solve for c in terms of a, or vice versa. For example, we can solve for c as follows:\n\nc = 278 - a   (by subtracting a from both sides of the first equation)\n\n3. We can substitute this expression for c into the second equation, and then solve for a. For example, we can do this as follows:\n\n1.5(278 - a) + 4a = 792   (by substituting 278 - a for c in the second equation)\n417 - 1.5a + 4a = 792    (by distributing the 1.5 to 278 - a)\n2.5a = 375          (by combining like terms and solving for a)\na = 150    (by dividing both sides by 2.5)\n\n4. We can use the value of a to solve for c. For example, we can do this by using either equation we set up earlier:\n\nc + a = 278    (by rearranging to solve for c)\nc = 278 - a\nc = 278 - 150\nc = 128\n\n5.

The owner explains to the supervisor how the two existing solutions can be mixed to obtain a 40 % acid solution. How much of each solution is needed?  Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Determine the amount of acid needed\n\nSince the shop needs 30 ounces of a 40% acid solution, we need to determine how much acid is required. \n\n30 ounces x 0.40 concentration = 12 ounces of acid required\n\nStep 2: Decide on ratios\n\nTo obtain a 40% acid solution, we can mix the 25% and 50% solutions in different ratios. Let\u2019s assume we need to use x ounces of the 25% solution and y ounces of the 50% solution.\n\nStep 3: Set up the equation\n\nSince we need a total of 30 ounces of the solution, we can set up an equation to show the relationship between the amount of acid and the total amount of solution:\n\nx + y = 30 (total volume of the solution)\n\nNext, we need to set up another equation to show the relationship between the amount of acid and the concentration of the solution:\n\n0.25x + 0.5y = 12 (total amount of acid required)\n\nStep 4: Solve for the variables\n\nWe now have two equations with two variables. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y.\n\nx + y = 30 (equation 1)\n\n0.25x + 0.5y = 12 (equation 2)\n\nMultiplying equation 1 by 0.25, we get:\n\n0.25x + 0.25y = 7.5 (equation 3)\n\nSubtracting equation 3 from equation 2, we get:\n\n0.25y = 4.5\n\ny = 18\n\nSubstituting y into equation 1, we get:\n\nx + 18 = 30\n\nx = 12\n\nTherefore, we need 12 ounces of the 25% solution and 18 ounces of the 50% solution to obtain 30 ounces of a 40% acid solution."}

Let's call the number of pencils Susan bought 'p' and the number of pens she bought 'n'. \n2. We know that each pencil costs 25 cents, which is equivalent to 0.25 dollars. Similarly, each pen costs 80 cents, which is equivalent to 0.8 dollars. \n3. We also know that Susan spent a total of 20 dollars. So we can set up an equation that relates the cost to the number of pens and pencils: \n\n0.25p + 0.8n = 20\n\n4. Since we want to solve for the number of pencils, we need to isolate 'p' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.8n from both sides: \n\n0.25p = 20 - 0.8n\n\n5. We can then divide both sides by 0.25 to solve for 'p': \n\np = (20 - 0.8n) / 0.25\n\n6. Now we need to use the fact that Susan bought a total of 36 pens and pencils. So we can set up another equation that relates 'p' and 'n': \n\np + n = 36\n\n7. We can use algebra to solve for 'n' in terms of 'p': \n\nn = 36 - p\n\n8. Now we can substitute this expression for 'n' into the equation we found earlier: \n\np = (20 - 0.8n) / 0.25\np = (20 - 0.8(36 - p)) / 0.25\n\n9. We can simplify this equation by distributing the 0.8: \n\np = (20 - 28.8 + 0.8p) / 0.25\n\n10. We can then simplify further by combining like terms: \n\np = (-8.8 + 0.8p) / 0.25\n\n11.

Then we can write:\n\nd1 = (r + c) x 2     (distance downstream)\nd2 = (r - c) x 4     (distance upstream)\n\nFrom these equations, we can isolate r and c as follows:\n\nr = (d1/d2 + 3) x c\nc = (d2/d1 - 1/3) x r\n\nStep 4: Solve for r and c.\nWe'll start by solving for r using the first equation above.

How much did the book sell for on Friday?  Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Let's call the price of each book sold on Thursday 'x'\n\nStep 2: We can then calculate the total amount Norbert made on Thursday as: \n\nTotal amount on Thursday = 23x\n\nStep 3: On Friday, Norbert sold the same books, but at 0.50 dollars less per book. So, the price of each book on Friday would be 'x-0.50'\n\nStep 4: Norbert sold 35 books on Friday, so the total amount he made on Friday would be:\n\nTotal amount on Friday = 35(x-0.50)\n\nStep 5: The problem tells us that Norbert made a total of 490.00 dollars from selling books on Thursday and Friday combined. So, we can write the equation:\n\nTotal amount on Thursday + Total amount on Friday = 490\n\n23x + 35(x-0.50) = 490\n\nStep 6: Now we can solve for x:\n\n23x + 35x - 17.5 = 490\n\n58x = 507.5\n\nx = 8.75\n\nStep 7: So, Norbert sold each book on Thursday for 8.75 dollars. To find out how much he sold each book for on Friday, we can use the equation we wrote in Step 3:\n\nx-0.50 = 8.75 - 0.50 = 8.25\n\nTherefore, Norbert sold each book on Friday for 8.25 dollars."}

If the total bill was 450 dollars , how man hours did the job take?  Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\n1. First, we need to determine how much of the total bill is attributed to the cost of labor and how much is for the cost of parts.\nTo do this, we subtract the cost of parts ($225) from the total bill ($450):\n$450 - $225 = $225\n\nSo, $225 is the total cost of labor.\n\n2. We know that the mechanic charges $45 per hour of labor. Therefore, to find out how many hours the job took, we need to divide the total cost of labor ($225) by the hourly labor rate ($45):\n$225 \u00f7 $45 = 5\n\nSo, it took 5 hours for the mechanic to complete the job."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to use algebra. Let x be the number of boxes of peppermint and y be the number of boxes of candy canes. Then we have two equations:\n\nx + y = 25         (1)      (because you bought 25 boxes in total)\n1x + 1.3y = 28     (2)      (because you spent 28 dollars)\n\nNow we can use one of several methods to solve these equations. Let's use substitution:\n\nFrom (1) we can solve for y:\n\ny = 25 - x\n\nWe can substitute this expression for y into (2):\n\n1x + 1.3(25 - x) = 28\n\nNow we can simplify and solve for x:\n\n1x + 32.5 - 1.3x = 28\n-0.3x = -4.5\nx = 15\n\nSo you bought 15 boxes of peppermint. We can use equation (1) to find the number of candy cane boxes:\n\ny = 25 - x = 25 - 15 = 10\n\nSo you bought 10 boxes of candy canes."}

We can then write an equation for the total amount collected: \n\nTotal amount = cost per student ticket * number of student tickets + cost per non-student ticket * number of non-student tickets\n\n1933 = 2x + 3(821-x)\n\nHere, we are using the fact that the total number of tickets sold is 821, so the number of non-student tickets is 821-x.\n\n3. Simplify the equation by distributing the 3:\n\n1933 = 2x + 2463 - 3x\n\n4. Combine like terms and solve for x:\n\nx = 530\n\nSo 530 student tickets were sold."}

She paid her bill with 5-dollar notes and 20-dollar notes using a total of 13 notes. How many 5-dollar notes were used? How many 20-dollar notes were used?  Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "Step 1: Let's start by figuring out the total number of notes Mrs. Naidu used. We know that she used a total of 13 notes, so we can write:\n\n5x + 20y = 155 (where x is the number of 5-dollar notes and y is the number of 20-dollar notes)\n\nStep 2: We need to use this equation to solve for x and y, the number of notes of each denomination. One way to do this is to use substitution:\n\n- Solve for x in terms of y by rearranging the equation: 5x = 155 - 20y, so x = (155 - 20y) / 5\n- Substitute this expression for x into the original equation: (155 - 20y) / 5 + 20y = 13\n- Simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 5 (to get rid of the fractions): 155 - 20y + 100y = 65\n- Combine like terms: 80y = 90\n- Solve for y: y = 1.125\n- This doesn't make sense since we can't have a fraction of a note. However, we can see that there is only one possible value of y that would make the equation work, which is y = 1. We can then plug y = 1 into the equation and solve for x:\n\n5x + 20(1) = 155\n5x = 135\nx = 27\n\nStep 3: We can now check our answer by making sure that 27 five-dollar notes and 1 twenty-dollar note add up to $155:\n\n27(5) + 1(20) = 135 + 20 = 155\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Naidu used 27 five-dollar notes and 1 twenty-dollar note to pay for her groceries."}

Without this information, we cannot provide an exact answer. However, we can make some general observations:\n\n- If the Total Cost is less than 189,000 dollars, then W will be greater than 0 and C will be less than or equal to 4500 acres.\n- If the Total Cost is exactly 189,000 dollars, then W will be 0 and C will be 4500 acres.\n- If the Total Cost is greater than 189,000 dollars, then W will be 0 and C will be less than or equal to 4500 acres.\n\nBased on this information, we can say that if the Total Cost is closer to 189,000 dollars, then the Willey Farm Collective should plant more wheat. If the Total Cost is significantly less than or greater than 189,000 dollars, then the Collective should focus on planting corn or a combination of corn and wheat."}

To do this, we divide the cost of the armband by the price of a single ticket: \n\n15 / 0.75 = 20 \n\nSo, with the armband, we can go on up to 20 rides. \n\nNext, we need to figure out how much it would cost to go on 20 rides if we bought individual tickets. To do this, we multiply the number of rides by the price of a single ticket: \n\n20 x 0.75 = 15 \n\nSo, if we were to buy individual tickets for 20 rides, it would cost us 15 dollars, which is the same as the price of the armband. \n\nTherefore, if we plan on going on 20 or more rides, it would be more cost-effective to buy the armband. If we plan on going on fewer than 20 rides, it would be cheaper to buy individual tickets."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Define the variables. \n\nLet's call the speed of the boat in still water 's' (measured in miles per hour) and the speed of the current 'c' (also measured in miles per hour). \n\nStep 2: Use the formula for distance, rate, and time. \n\nDistance = Rate \u00d7 Time \n\nWe know that the boat travels 45 miles upstream (against the current) in 5 hours, so we can write: \n\n45 = (s - c) \u00d7 5 \n\nSimilarly, we know that the boat travels 45 miles downstream (with the current) in 3 hours: \n\n45 = (s + c) \u00d7 3 \n\nStep 3: Solve the system of equations. \n\nWe have two equations with two unknowns (s and c). Let's solve for one variable in terms of the other and substitute into the other equation. \n\nFrom the first equation: \n\ns - c = 9 \n\ns = 9 + c \n\nSubstitute this expression for s into the second equation: \n\n45 = (9 + c + c) \u00d7 3 \n\nSimplify: \n\n45 = (9 + 2c) \u00d7 3 \n\nDivide both sides by 3: \n\n15 = 9 + 2c \n\nSubtract 9 from both sides: \n\n6 = 2c \n\nDivide by 2: \n\nc = 3 \n\nStep 4: Find the value of s. \n\nNow that we know c = 3, we can plug it back into s = 9 + c: \n\ns = 9 + 3 = 12 \n\nTherefore, the speed of the boat in still water is 12 miles per hour, and the speed of the current is 3 miles per hour."}

In colder climates this mixture should contain 50 % antifreeze. If the radiator contains 4 gallons of fluid , how many gallons of radiator fluid should be drained and replaced with a mixture containing 80 % antifreeze?  Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Find the amount of antifreeze in the original mixture.\nSince the original mixture is 10% antifreeze, this means that out of every 100 gallons of mixture, 10 gallons are antifreeze. Therefore, out of the 4 gallons of fluid in the radiator, there are 10% * 4 gallons = 0.4 gallons of antifreeze.\n\nStep 2: Determine the amount of antifreeze needed in the new mixture.\nIn order to achieve a 50% antifreeze concentration, the new mixture would need to contain half antifreeze and half water. This means that for every 100 gallons of the new mixture, 50 gallons would be antifreeze. Since we are only replacing part of the original mixture, we can set up a proportion to find out how much fluid should be drained and replaced:\n\n0.4 gallons / 4 gallons = x gallons / (4-x) gallons\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n0.4(4-x) = 50x\n1.6 - 0.4x = 50x\n51x = 1.6\nx = 0.0313725\n\nSo we need to replace approximately 0.0313725 gallons of the original mixture with the 80% antifreeze mixture.\n\nStep 3: Find out how much of the new mixture is needed.\nSince we know that we need to replace about 0.0313725 gallons of the original mixture with the new 80% mixture, we can figure out how much of the new mixture we need to add by using the concentration formula:\n\n0.8x = 0.0313725\nx = 0.039215\n\nSo we need to add approximately 0.039215 gallons of the 80% antifreeze mixture.\n\nTherefore, we should drain and replace approximately 0.0313725 gallons of the original mixture with 0.039215 gallons of the 80% antifreeze mixture."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nTo break even, the total revenue must be equal to the total cost. Let's first calculate the total cost:\n\nTotal cost = Fixed cost + Variable cost\nVariable cost = Cost per unit * Number of units\n\nIn this case, the cost per unit is 0.60 dollars and the fixed cost is 7640 dollars per week. To find the number of units needed to break even, we need to solve for the number of units in the equation:\n\nRevenue = Total cost\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n4.60 * Number of units = 0.60 * Number of units + 7640\n\n4.00 * Number of units = 7640\n\nNumber of units = 7640 \u00f7 4.00\n\nNumber of units = 1910\n\nTherefore, Northwest Molded must mold and sell 1910 handles weekly to break even."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\n1. Let's assume x pounds of candy A and y pounds of candy B are mixed to get 5 pounds of 2 dollars per pound candy.\n\n2. Using the concept of weighted averages, we can express the total cost of the mixture as follows:\n\n2 = (3.20x + 1.70y)/5\n\nHere, we're equating the average cost per pound of the mixture to its target value of 2 dollars per pound.\n\n3. Simplifying the above equation, we get:\n\n6 = 3.20x + 1.70y\n\n4. We also know that the total weight of the mixture is 5 pounds. So, we can express this as:\n\nx + y = 5\n\n5.

We can use the formula for distance (distance = speed x time) to set up an equation: \n\n(distance traveled by first car) + (distance traveled by second car) = total distance \n\nStep 2: Plug in what we know \n\nWe can use the formula for distance to find how far each car has traveled after 5 hours: \n\ndistance traveled by first car = x km/h * 5 hours = 5x km \ndistance traveled by second car = (x+15) km/h * 5 hours = 5x + 75 km \n\nWe can plug these values into our equation: \n\n5x + 5x + 75 = 275 \n\nStep 3: Solve for x \n\nCombining like terms, we get: \n\n10x + 75 = 275 \n\nSubtracting 75 from both sides: \n\n10x = 200 \n\nDividing by 10: \n\nx = 20 \n\nSo the slower car is traveling at 20 km/h. \n\nStep 4: Find the faster car's speed \n\nWe know that the faster car is traveling 15 km/h faster than the slower car, so its speed is: \n\nx + 15 = 20 + 15 = 35 \n\nSo the faster car is traveling at 35 km/h. \n\nStep 5: Check \n\nLet's make sure our solution works: \n\nAfter 5 hours, the slower car has traveled: \n\ndistance traveled by first car = x km/h * 5 hours = 20 km/h * 5 hours = 100 km \n\nAfter 5 hours, the faster car has traveled: \n\ndistance traveled by second car = (x+15) km/h * 5 hours = 35 km/h * 5 hours = 175 km \n\nTotal distance traveled: \n\n100 + 175 = 275 km \n\nOur solution checks out, so we know the speeds of the two cars are 20 km/h and 35 km/h."}

We also know that the Lakers scored a total of 43 points, which we can express in terms of x and y using the values of each type of basket: 2x + 3y = 43.\n\n4. Now we have two equations with two variables. We can use algebra to solve for x and y. We'll use the substitution method, which means we solve one equation for one variable, then substitute that value into the other equation and solve for the remaining variable.\n\n5. From the first equation, we can easily solve for x in terms of y: x = 20 - y.\n\n6. We can then substitute this value for x into the second equation: 2(20 - y) + 3y = 43.\n\n7.

Then, the plane's ground speed when traveling eastward would be (x - y) mph, and the distance traveled would be 4000 miles.

Here, we'll use substitution.\n\nFrom the equation x + y = 50, we can solve for y in terms of x:\n\ny = 50 - x\n\nSubstituting this into the equation 0.32x + 0.12y = 10, we get:\n\n0.32x + 0.12(50 - x) = 10\n\nSimplifying and solving for x, we get:\n\n0.32x + 6 - 0.12x = 10\n\n0.20x = 4\n\nx = 20\n\nThis means that we need 20 liters of the 32% solution.\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation y = 50 - x, we get:\n\ny = 50 - 20 = 30\n\nThis means that we need 30 liters of the 12% solution.\n\nStep 4: Check the answer.\n\nWe can check if our answer is correct by calculating the amount of sodium in each solution and in the final solution:\n\nAmount of sodium in 32% solution = 0.32 x 20 = 6.4 liters\n\nAmount of sodium in 12% solution = 0.12 x 30 = 3.6 liters\n\nTotal amount of sodium in final solution = 10 liters\n\nSo, the amount of sodium in the final solution matches what we calculated in Step 1. Therefore, our answer is correct: the chemist needs to use 20 liters of the 32% solution and 30 liters of the 12% solution to produce 50 liters of the solution that is 20% sodium."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Determine the amount of acetic acid needed in the final solution\n\nTo make a 50 mL solution of 9% vinegar, we need to know how much acetic acid we need. A 9% vinegar solution means that 9% of the volume is acetic acid. Therefore, we need 50 mL x 9% = 4.5 mL of acetic acid in the final solution.\n\nStep 2: Use the amount of acetic acid needed to determine the amounts of the two vinegar solutions needed\n\nLet x be the amount of 5% vinegar solution needed, in milliliters.\nThen, the amount of acetic acid in this solution would be x mL x 5% = 0.05x mL.\nSimilarly, the amount of 10% vinegar solution needed would be (50 - x) mL, and the amount of acetic acid in this solution would be (50 - x) mL x 10% = 0.1(50 - x) mL.\n\nStep 3: Set up an equation to solve for x\n\nThe total amount of acetic acid in the final solution is the sum of the amounts of acetic acid in each of the two vinegar solutions. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.05x mL + 0.1(50 - x) mL = 4.5 mL\n\nStep 4: Solve for x\n\nSimplifying and solving for x, we get:\n\n0.05x mL + 5 mL - 0.1x mL = 4.5 mL\n-0.05x mL = -0.5 mL\nx = 10 mL\n\nTherefore, we need to mix 10 mL of the 5% vinegar solution and 40 mL of the 10% vinegar solution to make 50 mL of a 9% vinegar solution."}

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nLet's call the amount invested at 6% annual interest x and the amount invested at 9% annual interest y. \n\nWe know that the total amount invested is 10,000 dollars, so x + y = 10,000. \n\nWe also know that the interest earned on the amount invested at 6% is 6% of x, or 0.06x. The interest earned on the amount invested at 9% is 9% of y, or 0.09y. \n\nThe total interest earned is given as 684 dollars, so we can write the equation: \n\n0.06x + 0.09y = 684 \n\nNow we have two equations: \n\nx + y = 10,000 \n\n0.06x + 0.09y = 684 \n\nWe can use these equations to solve for x and y.

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Determine the amount of acid needed in the final solution\nTo determine how much of each solution is needed, we first need to figure out how much total acid should be in the final solution. We know the final solution will be 60 liters and have a concentration of 45%. Multiplying these two numbers together gives us:\n\n60 x 0.45 = 27\n\nTherefore, we need 27 liters of acid in the final solution.\n\nStep 2: Write two equations based on the amount of acid in each solution\nLet's call the amount of 40% solution we will use 'x' and the amount of the 55% solution we use 'y'. We know that:\n\nThe amount of acid in the 40% solution is 0.40x\nThe amount of acid in the 55% solution is 0.55y\n\nThese two equations describe the amount of acid that will be present in our final solution, depending on how much of each solution we use.\n\nStep 3: Write an equation based on the total amount of liquid\nWe know that we want to end up with 60 liters of final solution. So we can write:\n\nx + y = 60\n\nThis equation describes the total amount of liquid we will have in our final mix.\n\nStep 4: Solve the system of equations\nWe now have three equations that describe the amount of acid and the total volume of the final solution.

We can solve the third equation (x + y = 60) for one of the variables (let's say x):\n\nx = 60 - y\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for x into the first equation (0.40x + 0.55y = 27):\n\n0.40(60 - y) + 0.55y = 27\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n24 - 0.40y + 0.55y = 27\n\n0.15y = 3\n\ny = 20\n\nSo we need 20 liters of the 55% solution.\n\nTo find how much of the 40% solution we will need, we once again use the equation x + y = 60:\n\nx + y = 60\nx + 20 = 60\nx = 40\n\nTherefore, we need 40 liters of the 40% solution.\n\nIn summary, we need to use 20 liters of the 55% solution and 40 liters of the 40% solution to make 60 liters of a 45% solution."}

Therefore, we can write:\n\nx + y = 1800\n\nStep 2: Translate the concentration information into equations\n\nThe concentration of sugar in the final solution will be 60%. We can use this information to create another equation involving x and y. We know that the amount of sugar in the final solution from the 40% solution will be 0.4x and the amount of sugar from the 85% solution will be 0.85y. The total amount of sugar in the final solution will be:\n\n0.4x + 0.85y\n\nSince this is a 60% solution, we can also say that the amount of sugar in the final solution will be 0.6 times the total volume of the solution, which is 1800 milliliters:\n\n0.6(1800) = 1080\n\nWe can now set up an equation:\n\n0.4x + 0.85y = 1080\n\nStep 3: Solve for one variable in terms of the other\n\nTo solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution.

Then the amount of crude oil from the second source will be '50-x' (since we need a total of 50 gallons). \n\nStep 2: Write an equation based on the given information\nWe know that we want the final mixture to be 55% hydrocarbons. This means that the total amount of hydrocarbons in the mixture will be 0.55 times 50 gallons = 27.5 gallons. \n\nWe can express the total amount of hydrocarbons in terms of the amounts from each source. The amount of hydrocarbons from the first source will be 0.25x (since 25% of x is hydrocarbons). The amount of hydrocarbons from the second source will be 0.75(50-x) (since 75% of the remaining 50-x gallons is hydrocarbons). \n\nSo the equation is: \n\n0.25x + 0.75(50-x) = 27.5 \n\nThis equation represents the fact that the total amount of hydrocarbons in the mixture should be 27.5 gallons. \n\nStep 3: Solve the equation for x\nFirst, simplify the equation: \n\n0.25x + 37.5 - 0.75x = 27.5 \n\n-0.5x + 37.5 = 27.5 \n\n-0.5x = -10 \n\nx = 20 \n\nSo we need to use 20 gallons of crude oil from the first source, and 30 gallons from the second source. \n\nStep 4: Check the answer \nLet's make sure that if we mix 20 gallons of crude oil from the first source (which is 25% hydrocarbons) with 30 gallons of crude oil from the second source (which is 75% hydrocarbons), we will end up with 50 gallons of a mixture that is 55% hydrocarbons. \n\nThe total amount of hydrocarbons in the mixture will be: \n\n0.25(20) + 0.75(30) = 27.5 \n\nAnd the percentage of hydrocarbons in the final mixture will be: \n\n27.5 / 50 = 0.55 or 55% \n\nSo the answer is correct."}

{"date_time": "11/03/2023 20:16:08", "question_number": 447, "question": "During a 4th of July weekend , 32 vehicles became trapped on the Sunshine Skyway Bridge while it was being repaved. A recent city ordinance decreed that only cars with 4 wheels and trucks with six wheels could be on the bridge at any given time. If there were 148 tires that needed to be replaced to due to damage , how many cars and trucks were involved in the incident?  Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\n\n\n1. Let's start by using algebra to set up some equations. Let's call the number of cars on the bridge 'C' and the number of trucks 'T'. We know that there were 32 vehicles total, so:\n\nC + T = 32\n\n2. We also know that only cars with 4 wheels and trucks with 6 wheels were allowed on the bridge. If we assume that every vehicle had all its wheels (i.e. none were missing or damaged), we can set up an equation for the number of wheels on the bridge:\n\n4C + 6T = total number of wheels on the bridge\n\n3. But we know that there were some damaged tires that needed to be replaced. Let's call the number of damaged tires 'D'. Since each car has 4 tires and each truck has 6 tires, we can set up another equation:\n\n4C + 6T = total number of wheels on the bridge - D\n\n4. We're given that there were 148 damaged tires, so:\n\nD = 148\n\n5. Now we have two equations with two variables (C and T):\n\nC + T = 32\n\n4C + 6T = total number of wheels on the bridge - 148\n\n6. We need to solve for C and T. Let's start by eliminating C from the equations:\n\n4C + 4T = 128     (multiplying the first equation by 4 to get the same coefficient for C)\n\n4C + 6T = total number of wheels on the bridge - 148\n\n2T = total number of wheels on the bridge - 276\n\nT = (total number of wheels on the bridge - 276)/2\n\n7. Now we can substitute this expression for T into either of the two equations we started with. Let's use the first one:\n\nC + (total number of wheels on the bridge - 276)/2 = 32\n\nC + (total number of wheels on the bridge)/2 - 138 = 0\n\nC = 138 - (total number of wheels on the bridge)/2\n\n8. We can now substitute these expressions for C and T into the equation for the number of damaged tires:\n\n4C + 6T = total number of wheels on the bridge - 148\n\n4(138 - (total number of wheels on the bridge)/2) + 6((total number of wheels on the bridge) - 2T) = total number of wheels on the bridge - 148\n\n552 - 2(total number of wheels on the bridge) + 6(total number of wheels on the bridge) - 12((total number of wheels on the bridge) - 276) = total number of wheels on the bridge - 148\n\n552 - 2(total number of wheels on the bridge) + 6(total number of wheels on the bridge) - 12(total number of wheels on the bridge) + 3,312 = total number of wheels on the bridge - 148\n\n4(total number of wheels on the bridge) = 3,084\n\ntotal number of wheels on the bridge = 771\n\n9. Now we can use our expressions for C and T from step 7 to find out how many cars and trucks were involved:\n\nC = 138 - (771)/2 = 138 - 385.5 = -247.5\n\nT = (771 - 276)/2 = 247.5\n\n10. Uh oh, we have a problem. Our equation for C gives us a negative number, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. What went wrong?\n\n11. If we look at our equation for C, we see that we're subtracting the total number of wheels on the bridge from 138 and then dividing by 2. But the total number of wheels on the bridge is 771, which is much larger than 138. This means that we get a negative number when we subtract 771 from 138, and that's why we end up with a negative value for C. We made an assumption in step 2 that every vehicle had all its wheels, but that's not necessarily true when there are damaged tires.\n\n12. How can we fix this? One approach is to use trial and error. We know that there were 32 vehicles total, so let's start by assuming that all 32 were cars:\n\n4C = total number of wheels on the bridge - D\n\n4(32) = total number of wheels on the bridge - 148\n\ntotal number of wheels on the bridge = 300\n\nNow let's see if this works with our equation for T:\n\nT = (771 - 276)/2 = 247.5\n\nThis is a fraction, but it makes sense because we assumed that all 32 vehicles were cars, and we know from the problem that there were some damaged tires. If we assume that all the damaged tires were on trucks, we can calculate how many trucks there were:\n\n148 = 6T - 4C\n\n148 = 6T - 4(32)\n\n148 = 6T - 128\n\n6T = 276\n\nT = 46\n\nSo our final answer is that there were 32 cars and 46 trucks involved in the incident."}

Therefore, we can write:\n250(D20 + D45) = $6,800\n\nStep 2: Solve for the number of $20 sets purchased.\nTo find out how many $20 sets were purchased, we need to isolate the variable D20 in the equation:\n250(D20 + D45) = $6,800\nD20 + D45 = $6,800/250\nD20 + D45 = $27.20\n\nNow, we know that the total number of sets purchased is 250, so we can write:\nD20 + D45 = 250\n\nWe can use substitution to solve for D20:\nD20 + D45 = 250\nD20 + (27.20 - D20) = 250\n27.20 = 250 + D20\nD20 = 27.20 - 250\nD20 = -222.80\n\nWait a minute! A negative number of sets doesn't make sense. What went wrong?\n\nStep 3: Check for mistakes and adjust the approach.\nLooking back at our work, we realize that we made a mistake in step 2. We cannot use the substitution method because we do not know the exact value of D45. We can only find the total number of $45 sets purchased by subtracting the number of $20 sets from the total number of sets purchased. Then, we can use that information to find the number of $45 sets.\n\nSo, let's start again from step 2:\nStep 2: Solve for the number of $20 sets purchased.\nTo find out how many $20 sets were purchased, we need to isolate the variable D20 in the equation:\n250(D20 + D45) = $6,800\nD20 + D45 = $6,800/250\nD20 + D45 = $27.20\n\nWe can use the information that a set of dishes costs either $20 or $45 to rewrite the equation as:\nD20 \u00d7 $20 + D45 \u00d7 $45 = $6,800\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\nD20 + D45 = $27.20\nD20 \u00d7 $20 + D45 \u00d7 $45 = $6,800\n\nWe can now use substitution to solve for D20:\nD20 = $27.20 - D45\n($27.20 - D45) \u00d7 $20 + D45 \u00d7 $45 = $6,800\n$544 - $20D45 + $45D45 = $6,800\n$25D45 = $6,256\nD45 = $6,256/$25\nD45 = 250.24\n\nStep 4: Find the number of $20 sets and check the answer.\nNow that we have found the number of $45 sets, we can use the equation D20 + D45 = 250 to find the number of $20 sets:\nD20 + D45 = 250\nD20 + 250.24 = 250\nD20 = 250 - 250.24\nD20 \u2248 -0.24\n\nOnce again, we have a negative number. What happened this time?\n\nStep 5: Double-check the calculations and assumptions.\nLooking back at our calculations, we realize that we made an assumption in step 2 that we did not check: that the number of $20 sets purchased added to the number of $45 sets purchased would equal the total number of sets purchased. This is not necessarily true, because some sets may have been sold at a different price point.\n\nSo, let's take a different approach:\nStep 2: Develop a system of equations.\nWe start with the same two equations:\nD20 + D45 = $6,800/250\nD20 \u00d7 $20 + D45 \u00d7 $45 = $6,800\n\nBut this time, we add a third equation to represent the fact that the total number of sets purchased is 250:\nD20 + D45 = 250\n\nWe now have three equations with three variables, which can be solved using substitution or elimination.

If 500 cups were sold for a total of 2090 dollars , how many plastic cups and ceramic cups were sold?  Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\n1. Assign variables: Let's use 'p' to represent the number of plastic cups sold and 'c' to represent the number of ceramic cups sold.\n2. Write equations: We know that the total number of cups sold is 500, so we can write the equation p + c = 500. We also know that the total revenue from cup sales is 2090 dollars, so we can write 3.25p + 4.50c = 2090.\n3. Solve the system of equations: We can use substitution or elimination to solve for p and c. Let's use elimination by multiplying the first equation by 3.25 to eliminate p. This gives us:\n\n     3.25p + 3.25c = 1625\n     3.25p + 4.50c = 2090\n\n     Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n\n     1.25c = 465\n\n     Solving for c gives c = 372. This means that 372 ceramic cups were sold.\n     \n4. Solve for p: Now we can substitute c = 372 back into either equation to solve for p. Let's use the first one:\n\n     p + 372 = 500\n     p = 128\n\n     This means that 128 plastic cups were sold.\n     \n5. Check the answer: We can check that our solution is correct by verifying that the total revenue from cup sales is 2090 dollars:\n\n     3.25(128) + 4.50(372) = 416 + 1674 = 2090\n     \n     So our answer is correct."}

To the nearest tenth , find the number of units of whole wheat flour and whole milk that must be mixed to make dough that has 75 grams of protein and 15 grams of fat.  Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nStep 1: Write the problem as two equations\n\nLet x be the number of units of whole wheat flour, and y be the number of units of whole milk.

To find x, we can plug this value back into either of the two equations we started with. Let's use the second one:\n\n- 2.5x + 3.7y = 15\n- 2.5x + 3.7(0.245) = 15\n- 2.5x \u2248 14.1\n- x \u2248 5.6\n\nStep 5: Check the answer\n\nWe should check that the values we found for x and y satisfy both equations. Let's check the equation for protein:\n\n- 13.6x + 3.4y = 75\n- 13.6(5.6) + 3.4(0.245) \u2248 75\n\nThis checks out. Similarly, we can check the equation for fat:\n\n- 2.5x + 3.7y = 15\n- 2.5(5.6) + 3.7(0.245) \u2248 15\n\nThis also checks out. Therefore, we can conclude that we need about 5.6 units of whole wheat flour and 0.245 units of whole milk to make the desired dough."}

We can write this as:\n\nWine + Cork = $2.10\n\nStep 3: We also know that a bottle of wine without a cork costs $2.00 more than the cork. This means that the price of the wine and without the cork is x + $2.00. We can write this as:\n\nWine + (Without Cork) = x + $2.00\n\nStep 4: Since both of these equations are describing the same bottle of wine, we can set them equal to each other:\n\nWine + Cork = Wine + (Without Cork)\n\nStep 5: We can simplify this equation by subtracting 'Wine' from both sides:\n\nCork = Without Cork\n\nStep 6: Now we can substitute x + $2.00 for 'Without Cork' in the equation above:\n\nCork = x + $2.00\n\nStep 7: Finally, we can substitute the value of Cork from the first equation:\n\nWine + Cork = $2.10\n\nWine + (x + $2.00) = $2.10\n\nStep 8: Solving for x, we get:\n\nWine + x = $0.10\n\nx = $0.10 - Wine\n\nStep 9: We don't know the price of the wine, but it doesn't matter since we only need to find the price of the cork.

According to the problem, the longer piece is two times the length of the shorter piece. So, we can express the length of the longer piece as 2x.\n3. We know that the total length of the pipe is 177 inches. Therefore, we can write an equation: x + 2x = 177 (the sum of the two pieces equals the total length)\n4.

Let's think things through step by step to get the right answer", "response": "\n\nFirst, we need to understand the concept of relative speed. When an object is moving against a headwind or with a tailwind, its speed relative to the ground will be different from its speed relative to the air. In this case, the speed of the plane with the tailwind is 460 mph, but its speed relative to the air would be lower because the tailwind is pushing it forward. Similarly, when flying against the tailwind, the speed of the plane relative to the air would be higher because it is pushing against the wind.\n\nLet's use algebraic equations to solve this problem. Let's call the speed of the plane relative to the air 'p' and the speed of the tailwind 't'. When flying with the tailwind, the effective speed of the plane is p + t, and when flying against the tailwind, it is p - t. We know that:\n\np + t = 460\np - t = 310\n\nWe can solve these two equations for 'p' and 't' using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use the method of elimination by adding the two equations together:\n\n(p + t) + (p - t) = 460 + 310\n2p = 770\np = 385\n\nNow we can substitute the value of 'p' into one of the original equations to solve for 't':\n\n385 + t = 460\nt = 75\n\nTherefore, the speed of the tailwind is 75 mph."}
