In other words, we want to find the value of x for which:\n\n1.12 + 0.22x < 0.3x\n\nFirst, we can simplify this inequality by subtracting 0.22x from both sides: \n\n1.12 < 0.08x\n\nNow we can divide both sides by 0.08: \n\n14 < x\n\nSo the Accucheck plan costs less than the Anywhere plan when the number of checks is greater than 14. \n\nTo check that this is true, we can plug in a value of x that is greater than 14 and compare the costs of the two plans.

Let B be Bill's current age, and let N be Ben's current age. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that:\n\nB + N = 91    (combined ages of Bill and Ben)\n\nLet's break down the second part of the problem. Let's say that x years ago, Bill was the same age as Ben is now. We don't know what x is yet, but we can write:\n\nB - x = N\n\nIn other words, x years ago, Bill's age was equal to Ben's current age.\n\nWe also know that at that time, Bill was twice as old as Ben was at that time. Again, we don't know what that age was, but we can write:\n\nB - x = 2(N - x)\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns. We can use them to solve for B and N.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the second equation:\n\nB - x = 2(N - x)\nB - x = 2N - 2x\nB = 2N - x\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for B into the first equation:\n\nB + N = 91\n2N - x + N = 91\n3N - x = 91\n\nWe have two equations (B - x = N and 3N - x = 91) with two unknowns (B and N). We can solve for x by subtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n3N - x = 91\n- (2N - x = 0)\n----------------\nN = 91 - x\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for N into the first equation:\n\nB + N = 91\nB + (91 - x) = 91\nB = x\n\nSo we have:\n\nB = x\nN = 91 - x\n\nWe still need to find x. We can use the equation B - x = 2(N - x), which we derived earlier:\n\nB - x = 2(N - x)\nx - x = 2(N - B)\n0 = 2(N - B)\n0 = 2(91 - x - x)\n0 = 2(91 - 2x)\n0 = 182 - 4x\n4x = 182\nx = 45.5\n\nSo Bill was 45.5 years old x years ago, when Ben was x years old. We can find their current ages by substituting x back into the expressions we derived earlier:\n\nB = x\nN = 91 - x\n\nTherefore, Bill is currently 45.5 years old, and Ben is currently 45.5 years younger than Bill, which is 45.5 years old.

We can write an equation based on this information:\n\n3w + 3r = 17.7\n\nWe also know that Stephan rode the water slide 2 times and the roller coaster 3 times, and the total cost was $15.54. We can write another equation based on this information:\n\n2w + 3r = 15.54\n\nWe now have two equations with two unknowns, which we can solve using substitution or elimination.\n\nLet's use elimination.

One possible solution is:\n\nw = $1.80, r = $4.30\n\nWith these values, Clarence rode the water slide 3 times for a total cost of 3 x $1.80 = $5.40, and the roller coaster 3 times for a total cost of 3 x $4.30 = $12.90. Similarly, Stephan rode the water slide 2 times for a total cost of 2 x $1.80 = $3.60, and the roller coaster 3 times for a total cost of 3 x $4.30 = $12.90.

We want to add some pure chocolate to this mixture to make a new mixture that is 75% chocolate. In other words, we want the new mixture to contain 0.75(220 + x) ounces of pure chocolate.\n\nSince we are only adding pure chocolate to the mixture, the amount of chocolate in the new mixture must be equal to the amount of pure chocolate.

Therefore, after z years, we have:\n\ny + z = 2(x + z)\n\nSubstituting the values we found earlier, we get:\n\n40 + z = 2(10 + z)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n40 + z = 20 + 2z\n\nSubtracting 20 from both sides, we get:\n\n20 + z = 2z\n\nSubtracting z from both sides, we get:\n\n20 = z\n\nTherefore, it will take 20 more years for the father's age to be twice that of his son."}

Let's try using a different approach.\n\nWe know that the time it takes the steamer to travel downstream plus the time it takes to travel upstream is 35 hours (15 hours + 20 hours). We can set up an equation based on this:\n\nd / (b + 3) + d / (b - 3) = 35\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nd(b - 3) + d(b + 3) = 35(b^2 - 9)\n\nExpanding the multiplication, we get:\n\n2db = 35b^2 - 315\n\nSubstituting 2d = 35d / 17 (since 2d = d + d/2, and we know that the time it takes to travel downstream is 15 hours and upstream is 20 hours, so the average speed is 2d/35 hours), we get:\n\n35d / 17 b = 35b^2 - 315\n\nDividing both sides by 35, we get:\n\nd / 17 b = b^2 - 9\n\nMultiplying both sides by 17b, we get:\n\nd = 17b^3 - 153b\n\nNow we need to find the value of 'b' that will give us the correct distance 'd'. We can do this by substituting the speed of the boat (in still water) into the equation and seeing what distance we get. \n\nLet's try 'b' = 12 km/hr (this is just a guess, but we can adjust it if we don't get the right answer). \n\nSubstituting b = 12 into the equation, we get:\n\nd = 17(12)^3 - 153(12)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nd = 6084 km\n\nTherefore, the distance between the two towns is 6084 km."}

Let's call them 'b' and 'c', respectively.\n\nWe know that the distance Adriana covered both ways is 18 kilometers, so:\n\nDownriver distance = Upstream distance = 18 km\n\nWe also know that the time it took Adriana to travel downriver and upstream are:\n\nDownriver time = 2 hours\nUpstream time = 3 hours\n\nThe speed of the boat relative to the water (i.e., the speed of the boat with no current) is the average of its speeds downriver and upstream, which can be expressed as:\n\n(b + c) / 2 = Downriver distance / Downriver time\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nb + c = 18 / 2 = 9\n\nSimilarly, the speed of the boat against the current (i.e., the speed of the boat relative to the river) is the difference between its speeds downriver and upstream, which can be expressed as:\n\n(b - c) = Upstream distance / Upstream time\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nb - c = 18 / 3 = 6\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for 'b' and 'c' by adding the two equations together:\n\n(b + c) + (b - c) = 9 + 6\n\n2b = 15\n\nb = 7.5\n\nSubstituting the value of 'b' into one of the earlier equations, we can solve for 'c':\n\nb + c = 9\n\n7.5 + c = 9\n\nc = 1.5\n\nTherefore, the speed of the boat in still water is 7.5 km/h and the speed of the current of the river is 1.5 km/h."}

His speed on the way to the telephone is 5 m/s and his speed on the way back is 4 m/s . Find the distance to the telephone .", "response": "\n\nLet's start by using the formula:\n\ndistance = speed x time\n\nLet d be the distance to the telephone.\n\nOn the way to the telephone, the man runs at a speed of 5 m/s for some time t, so the distance he covers is:\n\ndistance on the way to the telephone = 5t\n\nOn the way back, the man runs at a speed of 4 m/s for the remaining time (15 minutes minus the time he spent running to the telephone), which is:\n\ndistance on the way back = 4(15/60 - t) = (4/3) - (4/15)t\n\nNotice that we converted the time from minutes to hours (15/60 = 1/4) for convenience.\n\nThe total distance the man runs is the sum of these distances, which should be equal to the distance to the telephone:\n\nd = distance on the way to the telephone + distance on the way back\nd = 5t + (4/3) - (4/15)t\nd = (71/15)t + (4/3)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of t that makes the above equation true. We know that the total time the man takes is 15 minutes, or 1/4 hour:\n\nt + (15/60 - t) = 1/4\nt = 1/20\n\nPlugging this value of t into the equation for d, we get:\n\nd = (71/15) x (1/20) + (4/3) = 19/3 = 6.33 meters\n\nTherefore, the distance to the telephone is approximately 6.33 meters."}

Therefore, the time it takes her to drive home is:\n\ntime = distance / speed = d / 40\n\nWe know that her round trip takes 1 hour to complete. Therefore, we can write an equation:\n\nd/60 + d/40 = 1\n\nNow we can simplify and solve for 'd':\n\n(2d + 3d) / 120 = 1\n\n5d = 120\n\nd = 24\n\nTherefore, Ms. Walker drives 24 miles each way."}

Then, according to the problem, the time it took to hike back down the hill is '3 - t' (since the total time spent on the hiking trip was 3 hours).\n\nWe know that the rate of hiking up the hill is 4 mph. Therefore, the distance you hiked up the hill is:\n\ndistance = rate x time = 4t\n\nSimilarly, we know that the rate of hiking back down the hill is 6 mph. Therefore, the distance you hiked back down the hill is:\n\ndistance = rate x time = 6(3 - t)\n\nWe also know that the distance you hiked up the hill is the same as the distance you hiked back down the hill.

Then, the total amount of acid in the final mixture is `0.1x + 5` liters. Since the final mixture is 40% water, we know that 60% of it is acid. Thus:\n\n```\n0.6(0.1x + 5) = 0.4(x + 5)\n0.06x + 3 = 0.4x + 2\n0.34x = 1\nx = 2.94...\n```\n\nTherefore, approximately 2.94 liters of 10% acid should be added to the 5 liters of pure acid to obtain a final mixture that is 40% water. To find the amount of water in the final mixture, we can subtract the amount of acid from the total volume:\n\n```\ntotal volume = 2.94 + 5 = 7.94 liters\namount of water = 0.4(7.94) = 3.176 liters\n```\n\nSo there are approximately 3.176 liters of water in the final mixture."}

So we can write: \n\n4R1 + 9R2 = V/2 \n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns, so we can solve for R1 and R2. \n\nFirst, let's solve the first equation for R1: \n\nR1 = 1/12 - R2 \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for R1 into the second equation: \n\n4(1/12 - R2) + 9R2 = V/2 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n1/3 - 4R2 + 9R2 = V/2 \n\n5R2 = V/2 - 1/3 \n\nR2 = (V/2 - 1/3)/5 \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for R2 back into the equation for R1: \n\nR1 = 1/12 - (V/2 - 1/3)/5 \n\nSimplifying: \n\nR1 = 1/12 - (2V/10 - 2/15)/5 \n\nR1 = 1/12 - (4V/75 - 2/75) \n\nR1 = (6 - 16V/75)/60 \n\nSo we have expressions for both R1 and R2 in terms of V. \n\nTo find how long it would take each pipe to fill the pool separately, we can use the formula: \n\ntime = volume / rate \n\nFor the larger pipe: \n\ntime1 = V / R1 \n\ntime1 = V / [(6 - 16V/75)/60] \n\ntime1 = (10V/3 - 100/3) hours \n\nFor the smaller pipe: \n\ntime2 = V / R2 \n\ntime2 = V / [(V/2 - 1/3)/5] \n\ntime2 = 5(V/(2V - 1/3)) hours \n\nSo the larger pipe would take (10V/3 - 100/3) hours to fill the pool separately, and the smaller pipe would take 5(V/(2V - 1/3)) hours to fill the pool separately. We don't have enough information to find the exact values of these times, but we can see that the larger pipe is faster than the smaller pipe, since its rate is higher."}

Therefore, we can write an equation:\n\nx + y = 36   (equation 1)\n\nWe also know that the final solution is 13% hydrochloric acid. Therefore, we can write another equation to represent the total amount of hydrochloric acid in the final solution:\n\n0.18x + 0.09y = 0.13(36)\n\nSimplifying and solving for y:\n\n0.18x + 0.09y = 4.68\ny = (4.68 - 0.18x) / 0.09\n\nSubstituting this expression for y into equation 1:\n\nx + (4.68 - 0.18x) / 0.09 = 36\n\nMultiplying both sides by 0.09 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n0.09x + 4.68 - 2x = 324\n\nSimplifying and solving for x:\n\n-1.91x = -319.32\nx = 167.54\n\nTherefore, Mike needs to mix 167.54 ounces of the 18% hydrochloric acid solution and (36 - 167.54) = -131.54 ounces of the 9% hydrochloric acid solution. However, this negative value for 'y' doesn't make sense, indicating that there is no solution to the problem.\n\nTo check our answer, we can verify that the total amount of hydrochloric acid in the final solution is indeed 13%:\n\nTotal amount of hydrochloric acid in the 18% hydrochloric acid solution: \n\n0.18(167.54) = 30.16\n\nTotal amount of hydrochloric acid in the 9% hydrochloric acid solution: \n\n0.09(-131.54) = -11.84\n\nTotal amount of hydrochloric acid in the final solution: \n\n30.16 - 11.84 = 18.32\n\nTotal volume of the final solution: \n\n167.54 - 131.54 = 36\n\nTherefore, the final solution is not 13% hydrochloric acid.

Right before the work started , they received a new piece of machinery that helped them clean 10 more acres per day than originally planned . As a result of increased productivity in the last day before the deadline they only had to clean 30 acres . How many acres of wheat did the group of farmers have to clean ?", "response": "Let's denote the number of days the group of farmers worked before the new piece of machinery was received by $x$. Then, they cleaned $80x$ acres in total. After they received the new machinery, the number of cleaned acres per day increased to $80+10=90$ acres. Let's denote the number of days they worked with the new machinery by $y$. Then, they cleaned $90y$ acres during this time.\n\nSince they finished the work cleaning 30 acres less than originally planned, we can set up the equation:\n\n$$80x+90y=80x+80y-30$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$10y=30$$\n\nTherefore, $y=3$, and they worked with the new machinery for three days. Using this information, we can find the total number of acres of wheat the group of farmers had to clean:\n\n$$80x+90y=80x+90\\cdot 3=80x+270=80(x+3.375)$$\n\nSo the group of farmers had to clean 80 acres of wheat per day for $x+3.375$ days, where $x$ is the number of days they worked before the new machinery was received. Since the number of days worked must be a whole number, the closest possible value for $x+3.375$ is 4. Therefore, the group of farmers had to clean $80\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{320}$ acres of wheat."}

Here, we will use substitution:\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second equation for y:\n\n(2x + 1) - x = 18\n\nSimplify and solve for x:\n\nx + 1 = 18\nx = 17\n\nNow that we know Monica's sister is 17, we can use equation 1 to find Monica's age:\n\ny = 2x + 1\ny = 2(17) + 1\ny = 35\n\nTherefore, Monica is 35 and her sister is 17."}
